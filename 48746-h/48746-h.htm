<h2><a name="LESSON_VIII" id="LESSON_VIII">LESSON VIII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Foods of Vegetable Origin</span></h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<h4>GRAINS</h4>

<p>Grains constitute the most important
article of human food, not so much on
account of their superior nutritive, curative
or remedial value, but chiefly because
of their prolific growth and abundant
production in all civilized countries
throughout the world.</p>

<p>The variety of grain produced in the
various countries depends largely upon
the climate and the habits of the people.</p>

<p>The predominant use of rice by the
Asiatics, wheat by the Europeans, and
maize by the aboriginal American, shows
how people adapt themselves to the foods
of prodigal growth. It also shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
effect different foods have upon the physical
development of the various tribes that
inhabit these remote countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wheat</div>

<p>Wheat is said by some writers to be a
complete food. This is not strictly true.
Wheat contains a very small
percentage of fat, and while
fat can be made in the body from carbohydrates,
it is more natural, and entails
less work upon the digestive organs and
the liver if the diet is balanced so as to
contain the required amount of fat, and
all other nutritive elements in the right
or natural proportions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of eating
too much
starch</div>

<p>A diet composed of wheat alone would
contain 70 per cent of carbohydrates,
chiefly in the form of starch.
While this would be perfectly
wholesome, it would
give the body an excess of starch which
would ultimately result in intestinal congestion,
gout, rheumatism, hardening of
the arteries, and premature old age.
Wheat contains a larger quantity, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
greater variety of proteids than any other
grain, but wheat proteids are more difficult
to digest than the proteids of milk,
eggs, or nuts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of wheat</div>

<p>Wheat varies greatly in composition,
according to the soil and the climate in
which it is produced. This
fact is not recognized or
considered by the average
writer on dietetics, who eulogizes wheat
as the wonderful "staff of life," because
certain food tables show that wheat contains
13 per cent, while corn contains
only 10 per cent of proteids. It is neither
the proteid nor the carbohydrate content
that determines the value of any grain as
food, but rather the proportions of the
different elements of nutrition it contains,
that being the best which is more nearly
balanced to meet the requirements of the
human organism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rye</div>

<p>Rye may be considered in the same
class as wheat. Chemically, the contents
are very similar, and the effects upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
body are very much the same. It contains
a larger per cent of cellulose, and
less gluten than wheat, therefore
as a remedial food it is
superior to all other grains for exciting
intestinal peristalsis, thereby removing
the causes of constipation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Barley</div>

<p>The nutritive elements of barley are
similar to those of wheat and rye. It
contains less cellulose fiber,
and therefore a larger per
cent of digestible nutrients than any one
of the cereal group except rice. It has
never become popular as a bread-making
grain because&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">1 The nitrogenous or gluten substances
are not tenacious
enough to make the conventional
"raised" bread</p>

<p class="hanging">2 The flour is dark in color</p>

<p class="hanging">3 The grain is so hard and "flinty"
that it is very difficult to mill
it down to the required fineness</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">For these reasons barley has been greatly
neglected as a food commodity. From a
chemical standpoint it deserves a much
higher place in our dietaries than it has
hitherto been given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oats</div>

<p>The composition of oats varies somewhat
from that of wheat, rye and barley.
They contain a larger proportion
of both fat and proteids,
and form a desirable food if correctly
prepared. The objection to oats
as an article of diet is the hasty manner
in which they are usually prepared, which
converts them into a gummy mass of
gelatinized starch, entangled with the
peculiar gummy proteid of the oat grain.
Thus prepared the oat is a most prolific
source of disturbed digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corn</div>

<p>Corn is the cheapest material capable
of nourishing the human body that is
produced in the temperate
zone. It is less digestible,
and more deficient in the salts than the
group of grains thus far mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
It is very wholesome, however, but in no
way superior to other grains. In the
future corn will probably play an increasing
part in the problem of feeding the
world, as a cheap source of carbohydrates,
and for the purpose of manufacturing
glucose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rice</div>

<p>In all tropical and semi-tropical countries
rice occupies the same position that
corn does in the temperate
zone. It is more deficient
in proteids and in fat than any other food
grain, while the starch of rice is more
easily digested than any other form of
cereal starch. This grain, however, is
almost entirely devoid of mineral constituents,
and for this reason it is productive
of serious nutritive derangements
when indulged in too freely. This deficiency
can be overcome by taking a
liberal quantity of green salads, or fresh
vegetables, whenever rice is eaten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buckwheat</div>

<p>Buckwheat is a grain whose consumption
is very limited, owing to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
that it is dark in color. It compares
favorably with wheat and
corn as to nutritive elements,
and is now much used as a winter
food by the northern people.</p>


<h5>USES OF GRAINS</h5>

<p>The use of grains as an article of
food may be considered under three
headings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 As a source of energy</p>

<p>2 As a source of nitrogen</p>

<p>3 Grain as a remedial food; that
is, as a source of cellulose or
roughness, for the regulation
of intestinal action</p></blockquote>


<h6>(1) GRAIN AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY</h6>

<div class="sidenote">Too much
grain consumed</div>

<p>All grains are composed largely of
starch, therefore the question of energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to be derived from this source is one of
assimilation and use. The use of grains
in the diet deserves the most
careful consideration, and the
study should not be confined
to any particular grain, but to the entire
group, and especially to the method of
preparation, and the quantity that should
be consumed under the varying conditions
of age, temperature of environment, and
work or activity. The conventional
American diet contains such an abnormal
quantity of grain-starch, and the methods
of preparation are so unnatural, that the
Food Scientist, in practise, will find many
people whose digestive organs have become
so deranged that he may deem it
necessary to prohibit grain-starch almost
entirely.</p>

<p>The grown person, pursuing the ordinary
sedative occupation, should not eat
more than three or four ounces of cereal
food a day, while the manual laborer
should not consume more than five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
six ounces each twenty-four hours. This
quantity contemplates cool, or winter
weather. In summer this quantity
should be reduced according to work or
activity.</p>


<h6>(2) GRAIN AS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN</h6>

<p>Grain as a source of proteid has received
undue consideration in hygienic works.
Upon an allowance of one-fourth of a
pound of grain per day, which would
make four vienos, with a nitrogen factor
of six, we see that 24 decigrams of nitrogen
would be supplied from the grain.
The variations between the proteids contained
in two varieties of breakfast food
is seldom more than two or three per cent.
This would amount to a variation in the
daily intake of nitrogen of about five
decigrams, an amount too little to be
worth consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Digestibility
of grain proteids</div>

<p>Grain proteids are not so easily digested
as are the proteids of eggs, mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>k
and nuts. The following list of grains
and grain products is given
in the order of the digestible
nitrogen they contain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 Gluten or dietetic foods<br />
2 Barley<br />
3 Macaroni<br />
4 White flour<br />
5 Whole wheat&mdash;Graham flour<br />
6 Rye<br />
7 Oatmeal<br />
8 Corn products<br />
9 Buckwheat<br />
10 Rice<br />
11 Pure starches<br />
</p></blockquote>


<h6>(3) GRAIN AS A REMEDIAL FOOD</h6>

<div class="sidenote">Remedial value
of the
whole grain</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wheat bran a
natural remedy
for constipation</div>

<p>Grain is constipating or laxative in
effect according to the way it is prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and eaten. Whole grain, especially wheat
and rye, will normalize intestinal action,
and in some cases act as a
laxative, while the same
grains made into flour,
and milled in the usual way, are constipating.
Ordinary wheat bran is one of
the most effective remedies known for
intestinal congestion, and it can be
administered or regulated with much
accuracy, according to the severity of the
case. An intelligent understanding of the
use of bran in treating constipation is
quite necessary. The object should be
to employ bran as a remedy in chronic
cases, and to vary the quantity, the
quality, and the cellulose content of the
meals. In rare cases, bran may produce
irritation; in such cases it
should be cooked three or
hours, and eaten only with
hot water. In other cases the mechanical
stimulation of the peristaltic action is not
effective. The practitioner can usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
determine these questions on the third or
the fourth day.</p>

<p>Bran should be administered about as
follows: In cases of severe constipation,
one rounding tablespoonful in water, just
after rising; one-half teacupful, cooked,
taken at each meal, and a heaping tablespoonful
in water just before retiring.</p>

<p>The following table gives, in the order
of their laxative effects, a few of the
principal grains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 Flaked or whole rye<br />
2 Flaked or whole wheat<br />
3 Flaked or whole barley<br />
4 Flaked or whole oats<br />
</p></blockquote>


<h4>NUTS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Nuts as heat
producers</div>

<p>The true nut is the seed of trees and
shrubs which stores the greater proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of food material for nourishing the
seedling in the form of vegetable oil. The
nut is very largely a fuel
food or heat producer, therefore
among the primitive
races, along the warmer belts of the
earth's surface, the nut was not of so
much importance, but in the northern
or colder countries, where the body-heat
meets with such powerful resistance from
climatic environment, the nut is of equal,
if not of more importance than fruits.</p>

<p>There are a few miscellaneous articles
of food that are classed as nuts, which
do not belong primarily to this group.</p>

<p>In the following discussion I will take
up the several varieties of nuts in the order
of their general value as articles of human
nutrition:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pine nuts</div>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of the pine
nut</div>

<div class="sidenote">The nitrogen
factor in nuts</div>

<p>There are several species of pine seeds
from many varieties of trees, and from
many different countries.
The Italian pine seed or nut,
called in Italy "Pignon," and in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
country "Pignolia," is the refined or
cleansed nut, called by the writer "protoid"
nut. This is a coined word given
to it because it contains the highest
percentage of protein of any other food
that has yet been analyzed. The "protoid"
nut contains 34 per cent protein,
47 per cent oil, 9 per cent carbohydrates,
4 per cent ash, and 6 per cent water.
The relative proportion of nitrogen to
energy is not so great as
in some other food products,
such as eggs, or skimmed
milk. These contain a large per cent
of water, so that the protoid nut, while
containing pound for pound more nitrogen
than any other known food, has a
lower nitrogen factor than foods which
do not contain so large a percentage of
fat. This same rule will
apply to all nuts. They are
rich in protein, but because
of the large amount of fat which supplies
energy in its most condensed form, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
nitrogen factor, which is the relation
between nitrogen and energy, is often
lower in many nuts than in grain. The
chief advantage of protoid nuts over
other varieties is in their softness, consequently
they are more digestible, and
more assimilable than any other specimen
of the nut family.</p>

<p>The pine nuts which grow prodigally
in the western part of the United States
are not so rich in protein as the protoid
nuts, but in other respects are very excellent
food. The annual crop of these
is about one million pounds, but is
variable, a full crop being produced only
about every third year. They are harvested
in a very crude way, chiefly by
Indians, from the remote districts of
New Mexico, Utah and California.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Almonds</div>

<p>The almond is a most desirable food.
It contains 17 per cent nitrogen, and 54
per cent fat. The flavor is
very agreeable, and the nuts,
in digestibility, rank next to protoid nuts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
They may be substituted for each other
in many dietaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pecans</div>

<p>The pecan, which is a species of hickory-nut,
contains 13 per cent protein, and
70 per cent fat. It is a very
delicious article of food,
though somewhat inferior to pine nuts
and almonds, in digestibility, and as a
source of nitrogen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brazil-nuts</div>

<p>Brazil-nuts contain 18 per cent protein
and 66 per cent fat, and rank high as
an article of body-heat and
energy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White walnuts</div>

<p>Soft-shelled or white walnuts are commonly
known as "English walnuts,"
though they are chiefly
grown in France and in California.
These nuts contain 24 per cent
protein, 63 per cent fat, and form one
of the staple nut foods of both Europe
and America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hazelnuts</div>

<p>Filberts or hazelnuts contain 15 per
cent protein, and 65 per cent fat. They
differ widely from the varieties hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
named, and are less digestible. They
should be masticated exceedingly
fine, and should not
be taken by one whose digestion is particularly
weak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Butternuts</div>

<p>Butternuts are a species of walnut.
They contain 27 per cent protein, 61
per cent fat, and rank in the
dietary along with English
walnuts and Brazil-nuts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beechnuts</div>

<p>Beechnuts contain 22 per cent protein
and 57 per cent fat. Owing to the difficulty
of gathering or harvesting,
these nuts have
never become popular as an article of
human food. They are in the grain
class, therefore rank high as an energy-producing
material.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cocoanuts</div>

<p>The cocoanut is a product of the palm
tree, and, while quite distinct from our
nuts of the temperate climate,
is a very valuable and
abundant food, deserving more extended
use. Cocoanut is about one-half fat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
contains 6 per cent protein and 28 per
cent carbohydrates. The milk of the
cocoanut is an excellent article of food,
and used by the natives in the tropics in
many remedial and medicinal ways.</p>


<h4>PEANUTS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Value of pea-nuts and soy-beans</div>

<p>Peanuts, which are so widely used as
food, are on the boundary line between
nuts and legumes. They
were classed as peas by some
of the early botanists, and
as nuts by others. The name indicates
the compromise that was made between
the two theories. Another legume, which
is largely used in Japan and China is the
soy-bean. Both the peanut and the soy-bean
are better balanced, and more
nutritious than common beans and peas.
They are similar in composition, and contain
about equal quantities of protein
and fat, some peanuts yielding as much
as 48 or 50 per cent oil. Neither are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
palatable in their natural state, but both
are very delicious when their starch
content is converted into dextrin by
roasting. The Japanese have a method
of preparing the soy-bean by a process of
fermenting, which renders the proteid
material very digestible. Soy-beans have
not yet been introduced into this country,
hence there will be little opportunity
to use them, and they will, therefore, not
be discussed here at length.</p>


<h4>LEGUMES</h4>

<p>Legumes are the seeds of a certain
group of plants grown in pods. The term
comes from a very ancient word, "legere,"
meaning <em>to gather</em>. Beans and peas are
the most familiar types of this group.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legumes rich in nitrogen</div>

<p>Legumes are rich in nitrogen, and some
varieties are also very rich in oil. They
are not equal to nuts in fuel
or food value, however, because
in the natural state
they are hard, somewhat indigestible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
unpalatable. These qualities are due to
the fact that the nitrogenous material
of legumes are radically different from
the nitrogen found in nuts, and belong
to a class not so desirable as food. Meat
may be omitted from the diet and legumes
adopted as the chief source of nitrogen,
but this change requires some knowledge
and careful feeding in the beginning.
Meat is digested wholly in the stomach
and does not require mastication (only
enough to be swallowed), while dried
or mature legumes require much mastication,
owing to the carbohydrates they
contain. The best form in which legumes
can be taken is in their green or immature
state, owing to the fact that the
immature starch they contain is readily
soluble, while mature legume starch is
rather difficult to digest.</p>


<h4>FRUITS</h4>

<p>The term "fruit" in a strictly botanical
sense includes a very wide range of vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
articles&mdash;the reproductive product
of trees, or other plants, such as grains,
legumes, nuts, berries, apples, peaches,
plums, etc. In this lesson, however, I will
apply the popular meaning to the term.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General composition
of fruit</div>

<p>The common succulent or juicy fruits,
including both tree fruits and berries,
have many properties in common.
The chemical composition
of these typical fruits
consists of from 80 to 85 per cent water,
5 to 15 per cent sugar, 1 to 5 per cent
organic or fruit-acids, and small quantities
of protein, cellulose, and the numerous
salts, a portion of which may be
combined with the fruit-acids. Some
unripe fruits contain starch and various
other carbohydrate substances, many of
which are distasteful and unwholesome.
On the other hand, when fruits become
over-ripe, and decay sets in, the sugar
is changed into carbon dioxid, alcohol,
and acetic acid, and the fruit rapidly
deteriorates in nutritive value and unwholesomeness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
These changes, together
with the loss of water, account for the
sponginess and the tastelessness of cold
storage and other long-kept fruits. All
varieties of fruit are best when they have
been allowed to ripen naturally on the
trees, but modern commercial conditions
demand that fruits for shipping purposes
be picked slightly immature, and allowed
to ripen in transit to the markets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dietetic value
of fruits</div>

<p>The fruit-acids are composed of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, and are burned
in the body the same as
sugar, or fats. The actual
energy-producing content of
fruit is not large, and depends almost
entirely upon the sugar content. The
nutrient elements of fruit consist of fruit-sugar,
combinations of salts, organic
acids, and various flavoring or aromatic
substances. These same salts, acids,
etc., purchased at the drug store, and
administered separately, would be of no
particular value, and might produce harmful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
results, but in the various combinations
of fruits they have very important
places in the diet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fruit as an aid
to digestion</div>

<p>One of the most important functions
that fruit performs in the body is that
of an artificial solvent, or an
aid to digestion. To make
food serve this purpose well
would require some knowledge in regard
to chemical harmonies, quantity, etc. To
illustrate: If the stomach does not secrete
a sufficient quantity of hydrochloric acid,
fruit-acid should be absolutely omitted,
as any acid, except hydrochloric acid
itself, tends to inhibit the formation of
the normal stomach acid. And this in
turn tends to fermentation of the sugars
and starches&mdash;causing acid fermentation
and all the symptoms that accompany
this condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of acid
fruits</div>

<p>So it is very important to prevent all
the causes and sources of fermentation
if we would prevent the development of
all the various diseases that arise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
acid conditions of the stomach, and autointoxication.
This explains why people
of rheumatic tendency cannot
take acid fruit. Citrus
fruits, however, and limes,
lemons, oranges, grape-fruit, etc., are
beneficial in rheumatism and conditions
of lowered blood alkalinity, because they
are changed to alkalis in the system, and
reinforce the blood alkalinity. People of
rheumatic tendency, therefore, should
confine the diet as nearly as possible to
starchless foods, omitting all but the
citrus fruits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classification
of fruit according
to acidity</div>

<p>In the lesson on "Vieno System of
Food Measurement" I give the energy
value of various fruits, and
also the nitrogen factor.
These tables consider fruits
in the same light with other foods; that
is, as sources of energy and nitrogen.
In the table which follows, the more
important fruits are grouped according
to their total acidity. The <em>figures</em> represent
the <em>volume</em> of <em>acidity</em>, not strength:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>The fruits in the above table are all
reasonably wholesome, and the particular
fruits to be used depend as much upon
convenience as upon the nature of the
food substances. The above groups,
however, will be given much attention
in dietetic prescriptions, and the food
scientist should become thoroughly familiar
with this classification.</p>

<p>Of the acid fruits, oranges are the best
and most desirable, and cranberries perhaps
the least.</p>

<p>Acid fruits are responsible for much
stomach and intestinal trouble. Food
was prior to life. Animal life on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
globe has been fitted into, and is the net
result of food; therefore, in the wonderful
adaptations of Nature, it is evident
that life will develop higher and better
by subsisting upon the food that grows
in its respective country.</p>

<p>Acid fruits, such as lemons, limes,
grapefruit, pineapples, and oranges, are
grown in the tropical and semi-tropical
countries, where the climate is warm,
and where people subsist largely upon
native vegetables. These fruits supply
the acids and the fruit-sugars which the
system requires in a warm climate.</p>

<p>In the tropics the people live out of
doors, the pores of the skin are kept open,
and the effete matter produced by acids
can be cast out of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils of acid
fruit in northern
countries</div>

<p>In northern countries people live largely
indoors, and are heavily clad except
during a very short term in
midsummer, therefore they
do not eliminate freely. They
subsist largely upon the heavier foods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
such as flesh and grains, both of which
require a large amount of hydrochloric
acid for digestion, hence when the acid
of fruits is added to the hydrochloric
acid, of which most people have a deficiency,
serious acid fermentation may
result.</p>

<p>Acid fermentation is the beginning of
nearly all stomach trouble, and is the
primary cause of many other ills. (See
"Fermentation," p. 424.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of subacid
fruits</div>

<p>Practically all the fruits of the subacid
group are excellent; however, on account
of the mechanical irritation
of the seeds, berries should
not be used in cases in which
the stomach and the intestines are irritated
or catarrhal. In such cases the
juice should be pressed from the fruit and
the seeds discarded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of non-acid
fruits</div>

<p>Of the non-acid fruits, raisins, figs, and
dates are excellent foods from the standpoint
of furnishing a large amount of sugar
in its very best form. <em>Very ripe</em> bananas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and <em>ripe</em> persimmons, especially the
large Japanese variety, are fruits which
have a distinct nature, and
are suited to a particular
purpose in dietetics.
These pulpy fruits are especially desirable
in all cases of digestive irritations
and disorders, because of the amount of
nourishment contained in them, which is
greater than that contained in the juicy
fruits. In my practice I seldom, if ever,
find a stomach so weak that it cannot
digest ripe persimmons and very ripe
bananas. I attribute much of my success
in treating such cases to the skillful use of
these products. The persimmon and the
banana as remedial and nutritive articles,
are the most valuable fruits grown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canned and
evaporated fruits</div>

<p>Raisins, prunes, figs, dates, apricots
and peaches are common types of fruit
preserved by the process of
evaporation, and when
soaked in clear water may
be restored to almost their original condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Evaporated fruit should not be
cooked. This is perhaps the most palatable
and wholesome method of preserving
fruit. Next in purity and importance
are the methods of canning, as practised
by the housewife. The ordinary commercial
preparations of canned fruits,
together with the many jams, marmalades
and jellies, are generally of doubtful,
if not inferior quality. The Pure Food
Law has accomplished much to establish
honesty in the preserving and the labeling
of food, but these products are still far
from ideal, and are not to be considered
where fresh or evaporated fruits are
obtainable.</p>


<h4>VEGETABLES</h4>

<p>In this group we may conveniently
class all food products not elsewhere
discussed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of lettuce</div>

<p>Beans, peas, and corn, when taken in
the immature state, are classed as vegetables.
The importance of this group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
of food products is not their great food
value per pound (succulent vegetables
contain anywhere from 75 to
95 per cent of water); it is
the great variety of nutritive
substances which they contain. Lettuce
contains cellulose, proteids, active chlorophyl,
pentoses, sugars and starches, representing
carbohydrates in various processes
of transformation; small quantities
of fat, and a relatively large per cent
of mineral salts, besides numerous flavoring
materials. All other edible plants
contain many of the same elements in
different proportions.</p>

<p>Edible vegetables may be conveniently
grouped according to that portion of the
plant which we consume. These groups
are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
a Above ground<br />
b Roots and tubers<br />
c Leafy or succulent<br />
d Cucurbita family<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>
<p class="noind">Melons, cantaloups, and tomatoes are
on the border line between vegetables
and fruits. The following groups of
vegetables are made up according to
these classifications:</p>


<p>VEGETABLES</p>

<p class="noind"><i>(a) Above Ground</i></p>

</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Value of succulent
vegetables</div>

<p>Succulent vegetables are very essential
in a well-rounded bill of fare, and the
neglect of their use is one of
the errors in dietetics. The
most important function of
succulent or leafy vegetables is in the
supply of pure water and mineral salts.
They give to the body that which cannot
be obtained elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vegetable juices aid the digestion of all food</div>

<p>The diet of the average person is
composed of too many solids, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of the carbohydrate class. Cereal products
compose a very large proportion of the
civilized diet, especially in
America, yet the starch of
cereals is the most difficult
of all starches to digest and to assimilate.
The water and solvent juices in fresh
vegetables and succulent plants are important
factors in the digestion and the
assimilation of cereal starches. The relative
importance of salads and succulent
plants in the diet may be graded according
to the following table:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1 Spinach</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">2 Turnip-tops</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">3 Dandelion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">4 Lettuce</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">9 Kale</span><br />
10 Watercress<br />
11 Parsley<br />
12 Beet-tops<br />
</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">The white potato</div>

<p>The Irish or white potato is the only
true tuber that is used very
extensively as an article of
food. It is formed chiefly of
starch and water. The starch of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
tuber is very coarse and much softer,
more soluble, and hence much more
digestible than the starch of cereals or
legumes. Baking is the best method of
preparing the white potato. The skins
or peeling should be eaten in order to
balance the diet as to cellulose, which
is a most important article in the excitation
of peristalsis of both the stomach
and the intestines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sweet potato</div>

<p>The sweet potato is a root, and differs
chiefly from the Irish potato in that it
contains more sugar and less
starch. The sweet potato is
more wholesome than the
Irish variety. Measured by its chemical
contents, it is one of the best foods of
all the tuber group.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Root vegetables</div>

<p>The root vegetables given in the order
of my preference are: Carrots, parsnips,
turnips and beets. Carrots
are exceedingly nutritious
and palatable in an uncooked
state, eaten with nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Tomatoes may be considered upon the
border line between vegetables and fruits.
They are exceedingly useful in cases of
intestinal congestion and torpidity of the
liver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The melon</div>

<p>The watermelon is very wholesome.
The water is rich in sugar, while the pulp
is composed of a soft fiber,
which is a mild stimulant to
the digestive and the excretory organs.
Muskmelons and cantaloups are rich in
natural sugar. They are non-acid, hence
in harmony with nearly every known
article of food. Considering their chemical
neutrality and food value, they are
about the best articles of diet in the
watery or juicy class.</p>

<p>The pumpkin and the squash, which
are closely related to the melon, are of
the genus cucurbita, and are divided into
three species:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 Pepo or pumpkin<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>2 Maxima or winter squash<br />
3 Moschata, the pear-shaped squash<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>With a slight variation of the water content,
all of these varieties contain much
the same elements of nutrition. However,
the pumpkin is most important
to the student of dietetics&mdash;(1) because
of its food value, and (2) because of its
prolific and universal growth.</p>


<h4>SUGARS AND SIRUPS</h4>

<p>It will aid the student greatly in comprehending
this subject if he will review
the chemical composition of sugars as
given in Lesson IV under "Carbohydrates,"
Vol. I, p. 107.)</p>

<p>Sugar in its various forms is a very
prolific food product. It is the principal
substance contained in nearly all fruits,
but we shall confine our discussion here
to the various sugars and sirups as they
appear in commerce, freed from the other
materials with which they are associated
in nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>


<h5>BEET-SUGAR</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of beet-sugar</div>

<p>Contrary to common belief, the greatest
proportion of the world's supply of
sugar comes from the sugar-beet.
Sugar, which was once
manufactured solely from the
maple-sap and the sugar-cane, was discovered
about one hundred years ago,
to be present in beets. A very interesting
historical fact is that the sugar-beet
industry owes its origin to the efforts of
Napoleon to supply France with home-produced
sugar, because of the tariff or
embargo laid upon foreign commerce. As
a result of this effort all of Central Europe
is now a heavy sugar-producing region.</p>

<p>The method of production and the
quantity of sugar contained in the sugar-beet
have been so greatly improved that
the present industry is quite able to compete
with the production of sugar from
cane in the tropical regions. Crude sugar
from sugar-beets is very unpalatable, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the refined or crystallized form of beet
sugar is chemically identical with cane-sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cane-sugar</div>

<p>Sugar-cane, though not so important
as formerly, is still grown very extensively
in several of the Southern
states&mdash;Cuba, Porto Rico,
and many semi-tropical countries. The
chief distinction between cane-sugar and
beet-sugar is that the crude cane-sugar,
before it is refined, is a very wholesome
and palatable product. The brown sugar
of commerce is uncrystallized, or unrefined
cane-sugar, and is fully as wholesome,
and to most tastes more palatable
than the granulated product. It is to be
regretted that fashion has decreed we
should use white sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Refined sugar</div>

<p>Refined sugar, whether produced from
beets or cane, is sometimes slightly contaminated
with sulfurous
acid and indigo, which are
used for bleaching purposes, and if present
in any quantity are very objectionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maple-sugar</div>

<p>Maple-sugar, which is made by boiling
or evaporating the sap of the sugar-maple,
is a product decidedly
superior in natural flavor to
either beet or cane-sugar. Maple-sugar
contains a small proportion of glucose
and levulose, but its chief distinction
from other sugars is a matter of flavor.
The hickory tree contains flavors somewhat
similar to the maple. A cheap substitute
for maple-sugar has been manufactured
by flavoring common sugar with
the extract of hickory bark.</p>

<p>The other forms of dry sugar obtainable
in the market are milk-sugar and
crystallized glucose. The chief use of
milk-sugar as an article of diet is in
humanizing cow's milk for infant feeding.
The dry glucose, or, as it is sometimes
called, grape-sugar, is not commonly
seen in the market for the reason that it
is difficult to crystallize, hence it is much
cheaper to market glucose in the form of
sirups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The manufacture,
composition and uses
of glucose</div>

<p>Commercial glucose, as was explained
in Lesson IV, is made by treating starch
with dilute acids, and its
wholesomeness depends entirely
upon the care with
which this is done. Theoretically, glucose
is a very good food. In practise it is
somewhat risky because cheap chemicals
used in its manufacture may leave harmful
and poisonous substances in the finished
product. The manufacture of
glucose is an excellent illustration of the
objections to man-made foods as compared
with natural foods. When we eat
grapes we know that we are taking one
of the most important substances required
in the life-processes in a perfectly pure,
unadulterated and wholesome form. Science
has taught man to manufacture the
identical substance that is found in the
grape from corn, which is a much cheaper
product, but the temptation to economize
for the sake of dividends, and to allow
the commercial spirit to control in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
manufacture of food products is always
present. For this reason the manufactured
article comes under suspicion, while
the natural form we know to be "exactly
as represented." The principal uses of
glucose are for table sirups and confectionery.
Pure glucose as an article of
food lacks flavor; for this reason the
usual method of manufacturing sirups is
to mix glucose and some other form of
sirup or molasses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sirups and molasses</div>

<p>The original sources of sirups, besides
commercial glucose, are cane-sirup, made
directly by evaporating the
juice of the sugar-cane;
maple-sirup, made from the
pure maple-sap; sorghum-sirup, or molasses,
from the juice of the sorghum-cane,
which is grown extensively in the
South and Central West; and last, yet
perhaps most common, "New Orleans"
molasses, which is the residue from the
manufacture of cane-sugar. This may
be very wholesome if taken from the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
drippings of the crystallized sugar, but
if taken from sugar refineries it contains
chemicals that have been used in the
refining and the bleaching processes, and
is a very doubtful product. An excellent
quality of sirup can be made in the home
by adding to the brown sugar a certain
quantity of water, and boiling down to
the desired consistency.</p>


<h5>HONEY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Honey, man's
only food from
the insect world</div>

<p>Honey occupies a very unique place,
as it is practically the only food substance
which man utilizes from
the insect world. Honey
cannot be strictly compared
with milk and eggs as a food product, as
the latter are complete foods for the
nourishment of young and growing animals,
hence must contain all food material
necessary to construct the animal body.
Honey, which is a carbohydrate, is gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and used as a food for the adult bee.
Pollen, or bee-bread, a nitrogenous substance,
is the food of the larvae or
young bees. This illustrates a very interesting
fact in physiological chemistry.
The insect differs radically from higher
animals in that its life is divided into
three complete stages. When the
adult insect, with its wings, emerges
from the cocoon or pupa, its growth
is complete. Some insects never take
any food in the adult stage; but the
adult bee takes food, which is practically
pure carbohydrates, and which
would not maintain the life of a young
animal.</p>

<p>Honey is composed chiefly of glucose
and levulose, with perhaps 10 per cent
of cane-sugar, depending upon the flowers
from which it is gathered. Honey is
extensively adulterated with glucose, and
sometimes with cane-sugar; thus the
natural flavors are impaired and the
product cheapened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>


<h5>CONFECTIONS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Evil effect of
confections</div>

<p>Under the general term of confections
are included all products manufactured
for the purpose of appealing
chiefly to the sense of taste
rather than to serve any special
purpose as food. The chief products
that enter into confections are the various
forms of sugars, chiefly glucose, because
of its cheapness; fruits, nut-kernels,
flavoring extracts, and coloring materials.
Many of the substances used are very
wholesome, yet the habit of eating confections
as a general rule should be discouraged,
if not condemned, the reasons
being&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 That the material from which
they are made is usually unknown
to the public, and the temptation
of manufacturers to use cheap or
adulterated material too often
controls, therefore quality is sacrificed
to profits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>2 Confections are usually eaten
without regard to appetite, or the
physical need of food.</p>

<p>3 The combination of things
from which confections are made
shows that they are put together
not for their food value, or nutritive
virtue, but wholly for the
purpose of appealing to an artificial
sense of taste, rather than natural
appetite. This destroys the appetite
for similar products in simpler
forms.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following are the best forms in
which sugar can be found, given in the
order of their importance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 Sweet fruits<br />
2 Honey<br />
3 Sorghum<br />
4 Maple-sugar or sirup<br />
5 Unrefined cane-sugar<br />
6 Refined cane-sugar<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Even glucose sirups are perfectly wholesome
when free from adulterants. The
mixing, fixing, refining and manufacturing
all go to make our sugar supply more
expensive and less wholesome than the
plain fruit-sugars, honey and sorghum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Application of the term "sweets" as herein used</div>

<p>In order to avoid repetition, all articles
containing sugar are referred to
throughout this work as
<em>sweets</em>. By "sweets" I mean
sugar, sirups, honey, and all
foods containing sugars, such as desserts,
soda-fountain drinks, and the limitless
number of confections. While carbohydrates
rank second in importance in the
human diet, yet Nature has made no
provision for sugar being taken in its
concentrated form. In this form it is
the most severe article of human diet,
and to its use can be traced the origin
of a vast number of stomach, intestinal,
and other disorders. Superacidity, fermentation,
intestinal gas, and the large
number of sympathetic disorders that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
follow these conditions are caused largely
by the overconsumption of sugars. It
would be equally as important for the
Federal Government, or the States, to
regulate the manufacture and the sale
of confections as to regulate the manufacture
and the sale of intoxicating
liquors.</p>


<h4>VEGETABLE OILS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Value of vegetable oils</div>

<p>Vegetable oils form too small a portion
of the modern bill of fare. Oils of vegetable
origin, whether taken
in their natural form or
pressed out, and used with
other foods, are the most valuable nutrients
known for the production of heat
and energy. By this statement I mean to
convey the idea that a given quantity of
fat will produce more heat and energy
than any other article of human nutrition,
and that vegetable fats are more valuable
than animal fats, because they are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
adapted to the fat metabolism of the
human body, and less likely to contain
harmful substances. Vegetable oils contain
a larger per cent of olein, which is
considered the most palatable and the
most valuable fat known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Olives and olive-oil</div>

<p>The olive is a unique plant, standing
along the border line between fruits and
nuts. Ripe olives contain
from 40 to 60 per cent oil, the
best quality of which is extracted
by cold pressure, the cheaper
grades being pressed out at higher temperature.
The superiority of olive-oil
is due to the fact that it is composed
almost wholly of olein; that it contains
very little fatty acids and other impurities,
and has a mild, sweet, and agreeable
flavor.</p>

<p>The adulteration of olive-oil has been
extensively practised, but the agitation
of pure food, and the demand for same
are improving the quality of this excellent
article of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cottonseed-oil</div>

<p>Cottonseed-oil is the largest vegetable
oil industry in America. It is also the
cheapest of vegetable oils.
The cottonseed-kernel from
which the oil is taken is not
an edible product. Though used as cattle
feed, it contains alkaloid substances which
sometimes have a poisonous effect when
fed too generously.</p>

<p>The methods of cottonseed-oil manufacture
are more complex than those of
olive-oil. The oil must be heated and
bleached with certain chemical agents,
and if designed for salad-oils, frequently
a portion of the stearin is removed to
make the oil more liquid.</p>

<p>When the cottonseed-oil is carefully
manufactured, it is considered to be
entirely free from harmful substances.
However, as the original material contains
poisonous combinations, and as chemical
agents are used in refining and bleaching,
cottonseed-oil products are open to the
same criticism as glucose and refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
sirups; that is, they are wholesome when
properly made, but cheap and careless
production renders the product undesirable
as food. Manufactured under careful
Government supervision, cottonseed-oil
will, no doubt, be one of the great
foods of the future. I recommend the
purer brands of cottonseed-oils, when
pure olive-oil cannot be obtained or
afforded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peanut-oil</div>

<p>Peanut-oil is an excellent food substance
which is almost entirely neglected
in this country. It contains
the best portion of the peanut.
Other vegetable oils, valuable as
foods, and the use of which is to be
recommended, are sesame-oil and sunflower-oil.
These products are not produced
extensively in this country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cocoa-butter</div>

<p>The cocoa-butter is pressed from the
beans from which cocoa and chocolate
are made. The butter has a
flavor similar to these articles.
Cocoa-butter should not be confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
with cocoanut-butter. These products
are very different in origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cocoanut-butter</div>

<p>Cocoanut-butter is not extensively used
in America as a food product, owing to
the fact that the exposed
fat globules oxidize very rapidly.
It is extensively used
in Germany, however, and with the
introduction of better methods of preservation,
we expect to see cocoanut-butter
more generally used in this country, as
the source from which it is derived is
almost unlimited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palm-oil</div>

<p>Palm-oil comes from a different species
of the palm plant than that which produces
the cocoanut. It is a
very inexpensive product and
one which is chiefly used in the production
of soap and candles, although it is perfectly
wholesome as a food. Such products
have not been utilized in this country
as food, because our boundless prairies
and corn-fields have made the production
of cattle and swine cheap, and our fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
supply has swung toward points of least
resistance.</p>

<p>Not all vegetable oils are edible or
wholesome. Some contain, in addition
to olein, stearin and palmitin, and other
fats quite as undesirable. Castor-oil, for
example, contains ricinolein, which is a
poison, and to which its purgative action
is due. Croton-oil is the most powerful
laxative known to medicine, owing to
the fact that Nature abhors a poison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linseed-oil</div>

<p>Linseed-oil contains large quantities
of linolein, which is the substance that
oxidizes, forming the stiff,
rubbery coat on the surface
of linseed-oil when exposed to the air.
This makes linseed-oil valuable matter
to the painter, but objectionable as a
food.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_IX" id="LESSON_IX">LESSON IX</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Drugs,
Stimulants, and Narcotics</span></h3>


<p>With the origin and the use of drugs
in the treatment of dis-ease, most people
are familiar. The purpose of this lesson,
however, is to give brief but accurate
information concerning the various chemical
elements and compounds termed
drugs or medicines.</p>

<p>Many of the medicines in common use
are neutral, having no particular effect
upon the body, and the effects attributed
to them are largely imaginary. Out of
the many thousands of chemical materials
found in nature, there are, however,
certain substances, groups, and compounds
which have most marked and
violent effect upon all forms of living
protoplasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ancient belief
concerning medicine</div>

<p>The general theory upon which the
practise of medicine rests is that certain
chemical substances which
are not found in the animal
body, and which have no
natural place therein, have mysterious
and beneficial effects; that they possess
certain powers, among which are the
rebuilding of dis-eased cells, and the
purifying of dis-eased blood. This belief
arose in a very remote age, when the
mind was primitive; when man was ignorant,
and controlled almost wholly
by superstition&mdash;when every natural phenomenon
was believed to be the work or
whim of some god, and every dis-ease
was thought to be the work of some devil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life the result
of chemical harmony</div>

<p>Modern science has proved all this to be
untrue. We know by the selective
processes through millions
of years of evolution that
those chemical substances
which work in harmony have become
associated so as to form life. We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
that life is merely an assemblement of
organic matter, very complex and little
understood; that it is eternally undergoing
chemical changes governed by the
natural laws of development and decay.
We know that conformity to certain
natural laws will produce physical ease,
and that violation of these laws will
produce dis-ease. We know that ease
is what we most desire, therefore the
trend of thought, throughout the world,
is to realize this desire by turning toward
the natural.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The material
upon which life depends</div>

<p>True food furnishes the foundation or
constructive material upon which all
life depends. Nearly all
other substances which affect
the human body are merely
disturbing elements that interfere with
the natural chemical processes of life.</p>

<p>To illustrate more fully these general
principles, we will take, for example, the
chemical changes that may take place
in the hemoglobin of the blood. Hemoglobin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
is a proteid containing iron. It is
a complex chemical compound and reacts
with other substances very readily. In
the lungs it combines with oxygen. In
the muscles, this oxyhemoglobin is again
received into the original body-substances.
This life-giving process is only one of the
many thousands selected by evolution
from the millions of chemical changes
possible in nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of carbon
monoxid upon the hemoglobin
of the blood</div>

<p>When carbon monoxid, which is present
in illuminating gas, is breathed into
the lungs, it combines with
hemoglobin, producing a
compound which prevents
the formation of oxyhemoglobin, thus
stopping the process of oxidation in the
body, and death is the result.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drug theory
declining</div>

<p>In proportion as science has shown the
origin of life, and the methods by which
it has been sustained and
developed, the use of drugs
as a remedial agent has declined.
This line of reasoning followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
to its logical end, points with unerring
certainty to the total abandonment of
the drug theory of treating dis-ease except,
perhaps, as anesthetics and disinfectants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment of
dis-ease by disinfection</div>

<p>The means of combating dis-ease by
disinfection is sometimes confused with
the general system of drugging.
The modern methods
of preventing and of combating
contagious dis-eases by disinfection
are in harmony with the best known sanitary
laws. These results depend, not
upon the ignorant and the harmful
theories on which general drug medication
was founded, but upon the latest and the
most scientific knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Patent medicines and the
doctor's prescription</div>

<p>In the recent magazine exposures of
patent medicines, the chief trend of
argument was that these
stock remedies were evil because
the user took opium,
cocain, or whisky without a doctor's
prescription. This standpoint is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
amusing than instructive. Just why a
poison taken without a doctor's prescription
should be dangerous, and its sale a
crime, while the sale and the use of the
same drug over a doctor's prescription
should be highly recommended, is rather
difficult to comprehend, and this the
enterprising journals have not explained.
The exposé that is most needed is not of a
few poisonous patent preparations, but
of the fundamental folly of interfering
with Nature's work by any form of
poisoning. Poison is poison whether
advertised in a newspaper as a "New
Discovery," or prescribed by a reputable
representative of the "Ancient Order of
Medicine Men."</p>

<p>In a lesson of this kind it is impractical
to classify all drugs accurately according
to their chemical nature. For convenience
of the student, however, the drugs
commonly used in medicine will be
divided into three groups, which have
common representatives, and whose general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
effect upon the human body are
well understood. These three groups are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
a Alkaloids and narcotics<br />
b Alcohols and related compounds<br />
c Poisonous mineral salts and acids<br />
</p></blockquote>


<h4>a ALKALOIDS AND NARCOTICS</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of alkaloids
upon the body</div>

<p>All alkaloids are of vegetable origin.
They all contain nitrogen, and in some
respects resemble ammonia.
Many of the alkaloid compounds
are used in medicine.
They affect primarily the nervous system,
and may cause freedom from pain, or
that abnormal state of exhilaration of
which the cocain addict is a typical
representative. Substances of this alkaloid
group doubtless have useful functions
in the plant in which they grew, but in
the animal body they are disturbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
factors. Among the most important
alkaloids may be mentioned opium, cocain,
nux vomica, and quinin.</p>


<h5>OPIUM</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of opium</div>

<p>Opium is the evaporated sap that flows
from incisions made in the unripe capsules
of certain Asiatic
species of poppy. It contains
a large number of chemical
compounds which belong to the
alkaloid group. The chief alkaloids in
opium are codein, narcotin, heroin, and
morphin, the most active being heroin.
Other alkaloids are of similar composition.
The general effects and the uses of
the crude opium and the refined morphin
may be considered together. The latter,
being more concentrated, is used in much
smaller quantities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of opium</div>

<p>The effect upon the body of either
opium or of morphin is that of benumbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the nerves and producing sleep. Opium
illustrates in a typical manner the progressive
stages by which
both the body and the mind
may become enslaved to
the influence of a narcotic. The last
stages of the opium or of the morphin
slave is probably the lowest state of
depravity into which the human being
can sink.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the
morphin habit</div>

<p>Opium is eaten or smoked by the
Chinese and by other Asiatic races to a
very great extent. This
habit is considered the worst
form of slavery to drugs
that is known except cocain. In this
country the morphin habit is the more
common form. Morphin is either taken
internally or is injected beneath the skin
by a hypodermic syringe. It is estimated
that the great majority of the morphin
slaves in this country begin the use of
this drug under "their" doctor's prescription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The several
uses of morphin</div>

<p>The use of opium as prescribed by
medical men is chiefly for the relief of
either pain or of insomnia.
Its employment in cases of
great agony is probably justifiable,
but the repeated taking of this
drug until the habit is formed becomes a
criminal blunder for which the doctor
who prescribed it should be held responsible.
Unfortunately this is only
one of the uses to which opium is
put by the medical profession. Prescriptions
containing either opium or
morphin are frequently given to relieve
pain, or to produce sleep, when
the primary trouble is chronic, and
should be treated by removing the
causes, and not alleviated by stupifying
the nerves. In the majority of such
cases, if the diet is balanced according
to age, activity, and climate, and vigorous
intestinal peristalsis created, sleep
will follow, and other disorders will gradually
disappear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opium in
patent medicines</div>

<p>The dangers that lurk in the use of
opium are so well known, and the habit
has become so unpopular,
that tricks are resorted to by
manufacturers of this drug
to deceive the people into believing that
they are using some "harmless" substance,
while it is the influence of the
opium that gives the medicine its apparent
good effect. Patent medicines which
claim to kill pain, soothe nerves, and produce
sleep, usually contain opium. The
popular "Soothing Sirups" for children
are nearly all opium products, and have
been given to millions of babies in this
country by deluded mothers, in the belief
that because it soothed, their innocent
child was being benefited. These are
the crimes of greed passed on to innocent
childhood through ignorance.</p>


<h5>COCAIN</h5>

<p>Cocain is an alkaloid, the use and the
influence of which are almost as noteworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
as that of morphin. Cocain is
derived from the leaves of the cocoa
plant which grows in the Andes of Peru.
Just as the Chinese use opium, so the
Peruvian Indians use cocain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uses and effects
of cocain</div>

<p>Owing to its hydrochloric-acid salt, the
effects of cocain differ somewhat from
those of opium. It produces
relative freedom from pain,
and is used more particularly
to produce insensibility in local
parts of the body, as in the case of extracting
teeth. The cocain slaves, which
are increasing alarmingly in this country,
usually take it by snuffing, or in an atomizer.
The habit is usually acquired, as in
the case of morphin, by the prescription
of a physician. The patient, learning
from experience the freedom from pain
and the sense of exhilaration that can be
produced by the drug, and not being
warned by "his" physician of its baneful
effects, continues the habit after the
doctor's treatment has ceased, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
awakes to find a monster owning his
body and his mind. The cocain
fiend, like the opium slave, develops
an insatiable desire for the drug,
and suffers extreme mental and physical
pain when deprived of the usual
allowance. The development of untruthfulness
and trickery in a person desiring
his allowance of a forbidden drug, is
one of the marked traits of the narcotic
slave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cocain in
patent medicines</div>

<p>There are a number of different medicines
which depend for their action
wholly upon the cocain they
contain. A large number of
catarrhal powders in the market
are diluted forms of cocain, and
are used extensively both by those
who do not realize the nature of
the drug they are using, and by those
who know that they are cocain slaves,
but prefer to disguise the fact in this
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>


<h5>NUX VOMICA AND STRYCHNIN</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
strychnin</div>

<p>Nux vomica is derived from the seeds
of a plant that grows in India. Strychnin
is the alkaloid which exists
therein. Strychnin is quite
different in its effects from
the above-mentioned alkaloids, for instead
of benumbing the nerves, causing
sleep or a pleasing sensation, the effect
is a nerve stimulus which causes muscular
convulsions.</p>

<p>The medical use of strychnin is more of
a stimulant than of a narcotic. It is one
of the most widely used of all the
drugs prescribed by the old school
physicians, and is extremely dangerous
in over-doses. Indeed, thousands of
people have been killed by strychnin
poisoning.</p>


<h5>QUININ</h5>

<p>Quinin is derived from Peruvian or
cinchona-bark. This bark, like the juice
of the poppy plant, contains a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
alkaloids. These alkaloids, in turn, may
react with acids, forming salts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The uses of
quinin</div>

<p>Sulfate of quinin is the most common
form of this drug. Its principal use is
for the destruction of the
malarial germ, and it is,
therefore, the standard drug
in all malarious countries. The germs
of malaria, however, are not bacteria
(microscopic plants, as many suppose),
but minute forms of animal life. Aside
from this particular use, the effect of
quinin is to disturb the nervous system,
produce insomnia, ringing of the ears&mdash;and
even deafness, in a great many
cases. It does not, however, produce
an addiction, as do morphin, cocain,
heroin, and other drugs.</p>


<h5>ACETANILID</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Composition and
effects of acetanilid</div>

<p>Acetanilid is one of the coal-tar poisons
and is chemically related to anilin. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
drug has come into use only within the past
few years, and of all the coal tar group
is one of the most remarkable
in its physiological
effects. Its influence is to
produce at first a deadening effect upon
the nervous system, which puts it in the
"pain-killer" class. Its continued use
destroys the hemoglobin of the blood
and produces marked cell-destroying effects
throughout the body. Its medical
use is for rheumatism, headache, severe
coughs, and the like.</p>

<p>A patent medicine now being widely
exploited advertises, "We print our
formula." So they do, and acetanilid is
one of the ingredients. The general
public does not know what acetanilid
is. The habitué of this "healthful drug"
experiences a craving similar to that of
other narcotic drug fiends.</p>

<p>A person who has long used a medicine
containing acetanilid shows a bluish-white
complexion caused by the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of red blood-corpuscles. I
merely mention this as an example to
show that a knowledge of the composition
of patent medicines does not protect
the public unless the public is made
familiar with the ingredients that compose
these medicines.</p>

<p>Acetanilid is the active principle in
many popular headache powders, the
formulas of which are not made public.
The use of acetanilid by those claiming
to cure suffering, or to relieve it, is one
of the most glaring malpractises of the
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil effects of
coal-tar products</div>

<p>Other coal-tar products chemically related
to acetanilid are antipyrin, phenacetin,
and various derivatives
of benzol and phenol. The
general uses of this class of
drugs are to reduce fevers and to allay
pain. They accomplish this by stupifying
the nerves and the nerve fibers, which
serve as telegraph wires to inform the
brain that something is wrong. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
equivalent to killing the messenger that
warns us of our sins.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the toxic
remedies used by old school physicians
in the treatment of nearly all forms of
dis-ease:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Laudanum&mdash;which is merely another
name for opium</p>

<p>Paregoric&mdash;a standard baby medicine
which is a tincture of opium
with camphor and other drugs</p>

<p>Codein&mdash;an alkaloid manufactured
from morphin</p>

<p>Lyoscine&mdash;the alkaloid of henbane</p>

<p>Atropin&mdash;an alkaloid extensively
used by oculists. (It is contained
with other alkaloids in
BELLADONNA, which, in turn,
is prepared from the plant known
as the "Deadly Nightshade")</p>

<p>Hellebore&mdash;a powerful alkaloid, is
one of the old standard drugs
used in the treatment of rheumatic
gout</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>


<h5>TOBACCO</h5>

<p>Tobacco belongs strictly to the narcotic
class of drugs. With the possible exception
of opium, tobacco is by far the most
detrimental narcotic used by man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of
nicotin</div>

<p>The active principle of tobacco is
nicotin, which resides in the leaves in
combination with malic acid.
Nicotin is an alkaloid, and
one of the most deadly poisons
known. In distilled form, nicotin,
even in minute quantities, produces death
almost instantaneously. The nicotin contained
in a pound of tobacco is sufficient
to kill several hundred men if administered
in the form of pure nicotin,
but in smoking and chewing tobacco only
a small amount of this poison is absorbed
into the body at one time, and, owing
to the gradual growth of the tobacco
habit, the system has time to partly
adjust itself to the use of this powerful
drug, enough at least to prevent acute
narcotic poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>The violent sickness caused by the
first use of tobacco evidences the poisonous
effects of the nicotin upon a body
not accustomed to its use.</p>

<p>Tobacco as a narcotic is not as drastic
in its effect as opium, morphin, and cocain;
for this reason its use is not so
generally condemned. Popular opinion,
however, is now rapidly recognizing that
all of these substances belong in the same
general class and are deteriorating factors
in human development. The rapid spread
of the cigarette habit among young boys
has done much to arouse popular agitation
against the tobacco evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General effect
of tobacco</div>

<p>From the standpoint of health, nothing
can be said in favor of the use of tobacco
in any form, as it gradually
deadens the sensitiveness and
control of the nervous system.
It preys with great violence upon
the optic nerves, and more than any other
drug known dethrones sexual vitality.
The tobacco heart, which is readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
recognized by medical practitioners,
shows the effect of this narcotic upon the
nervous system. The craving for tobacco
is closely related to the craving
for intoxicating liquors and for highly
seasoned food&mdash;three of the most potent
factors in perverting the true sense of
taste and arousing abnormal cravings
which destroy natural hunger.</p>

<p>Neither tobacco nor nicotin are now
used by medical practitioners. Tobacco
was formerly used as a purgative, and
also as a poultice to relieve swellings and
inflammation.</p>


<h5>COFFEE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of coffee</div>

<p>Coffee is one of the most extensively
used articles in the narcotic
group. The alkaloid which
gives coffee its characteristic
properties is caffein. Coffee also contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
from three to four per cent of tannic
acid. Other substances in coffee, to
which the pleasant odors and taste are
due, are various forms of fats and carbohydrates,
but these exist in such small
quantities as to be negligible food elements.
The effect of the caffein is that
of a nervous stimulant, increasing the
general nervous and mental activity.
Coffee is frequently used to keep people
awake. It is given as an antidote for
opium poisoning because it stimulates
the nervous system and prevents sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
coffee-drinking</div>

<p>Coffee, when used habitually,
produces various forms
of dyspepsia, especially hypersecretion
of hydrochloric acid, tannic
acid being the provoking factor. The
effect of coffee upon the nervous system
is that of continued stimulation or excitation.
Its continued use overworks
and wears out the nervous system, thus
causing a deterioration of both body and
mind. If caffein were taken in a highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
concentrated form, it would result in a
narcotic habit quite as enslaving as the
use of opium or cocain.</p>


<h5>TEA</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Composition
of tea</div>

<p>Tea, in its chemical composition, is
similar to coffee, containing even a greater
percentage of the alkaloid
caffein, and also a larger
percentage of tannic acid.
Tannic acid is present in larger quantities
in green tea than in the black variety.
In addition to the evil effects caused by
the caffein which it contains, tea is more
destructive to the normal activities of
the stomach because of the tannic acid.
The student may get some idea of what
the stomach of the tea-user has to contend
with, when it is stated that tannic acid
gets its name from the essential action
that this substance has in the process of
tanning leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>


<h5>COCOA AND CHOCOLATE</h5>

<p>The cocoa bean, which was mentioned
as the source of chocolate and cocoa-butter,
is also the source of the beverage
known as breakfast cocoa. The cocoa
bean contains caffein, though the per
cent is considerably less than in coffee or
tea. Cocoa is practically free from
tannic acid. For these reasons, and because
of its food value, it is decidedly
the least harmful of the stimulant beverages.
Cocoa, though being in reality
more tasteful and nutritious than either
coffee or tea, is less used because it lacks
the stimulating effect.</p>

<p>The various alkaloid poisons thus far
discussed form but an infinitesimal
part of the great group of articles
used by old school physicians in the
treatment of dis-ease, and by civilized
people as stimulating and sedative beverages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>


<h4>b ALCOHOLS AND RELATED COMPOUNDS</h4>

<p>The second group of drugs which is
associated with alcohol includes the
ethers, chloroform, and coal-tar products.
This group is also wholly of plant origin,
alcohol being distilled from plant products,
and coal-tar being formed from
petrified plants. These drugs always
contain the three elements carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen; some contain an additional
element which gives them their
peculiar property; for example, chloroform
contains chlorin.</p>

<p>Coal-tar is the most wonderful source
of drugs known. The distillation of this
substance produces coloring matter, preservatives,
poisons, and "pain killers"
ad infinitum.</p>


<h5>ALCOHOL</h5>

<p>The uses and the effects of alcohol
will not be discussed at length in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
lesson because the subject of alcohol is
constantly before the public, and its
evil effects universally known and acknowledged.
However, I deem it well to
examine a phase of the question which is
not so well understood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alcohol a
poison not a food</div>

<p>Whether or not alcohol is a food has
recently been discussed by a wide range
of writers. The answer of
science is that alcohol is a
food in the sense that it can
produce heat in the body. Even if
alcohol were a true food, the heat is
produced, however, by the increased
circulation of the blood, which is Nature's
warfare against a poison, and in the reaction
the vitality of the body is lowered.
Thus the true effect of the poison is
made manifest. Starvation is not the
danger that threatens mankind, but
OVERFEEDING and WRONG feeding.
Were we in danger of starvation, whisky
at one dollar a quart would not save us.
The very fact that alcohol produces heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
in the body, whether we call it a food or
not, only adds another reason why it
should not be used. It produces heat
by stimulating heart action; rapid heart
action is Nature's defense against the
intruding poison.</p>

<p>Alcohol taken in addition to food, and
in connection with it, produces surplus
heat, and overstimulates metabolism,
which is very harmful. It also adds one
more to the long list of detrimental effects
traceable to intoxicating beverages. Alcohol
is a food in the same sense that
dynamite is a fuel. Dynamite produces
heat, but it would be an unwise fireman
who would use it under his boiler.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Correct eating
the best treatment
for the drink-habit</div>

<p>Another point regarding the use of
alcohol that is worthy of consideration,
is the fact that improper
nutrition, together with the
over-ingestion of stimulating
and heating foods such as meat and
condiments, invariably increase the appetite
for intoxicants. The appetite for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
alcohol seldom, if ever, develops in a
perfectly nourished body, and the best
treatment known for the drink-habit is a
careful course of balanced dieting and
hygienic methods of living. Alcohol is
purely a stimulant. It increases the
heart action, the circulation, the production
of heat, and the general vital activities.
It is an offense to Nature, and the
body calls into activity all her powers
to cast out the poison. When the influence
of alcohol has run its course,
there is a reaction or stupor which calls
for more of the same drug. This indulgence
cultivates the desire through
both the body-functions and the appetite,
and the blighting habit dethrones the
reason, thus rendering useless the lives
of millions of worthy people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why alcohol
is used in patent medicines</div>

<p>The prescribing of alcohol by physicians
has chiefly descended
from the ancient idea that alcohol
was strengthening and
beneficial to the body. The practise is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
being discontinued by many reputable
physicians, which proves that no great
benefits, in dis-ease, can be derived from
its use. The regular use of alcohol in
small doses gives the patient the feeling
of physical exhilaration, and is therefore
an excellent means of making him believe
that he is being benefited. For this
reason, and because of its cheapness, low
grade alcohol is the chief component of
many medicines.</p>

<p>The following table gives the percentage
of alcohol contained in a few patent
medicines, previous to the popular exposé
of the subject. (I do not vouch for the
accuracy of this table at the present
time, as the manufacturers under the
pressure of public opinion may have
changed their formulas):</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="alcohol">
<tr><td align="left">Peruna</td><td align="right">28%</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Hostetter's Bitters</td><td align="right">44%</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Lydia Pinkham's Compound</td><td align="right">20%</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Hood's Sarsaparilla</td><td align="right">18%</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Ayer's Sarsaparilla</td><td align="right">26%</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Paine's Celery Compound</td><td align="right">21%</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the past few years these facts
have been made public, resulting in a
heavy decline in the sale of these concoctions.
The number of good temperance
people who have been innocently
under the influence of alcohol for a goodly
portion of their days can only be vaguely
estimated.</p>


<h5>CHLOROFORM, ETHER, AND CHLORAL</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Uses of chloroform,
ether and chloral</div>

<p>These drugs are chemically related to
alcohol, and are typical anesthetics, which
mean that they produce temporary
relief from pain when
the vapors are inhaled. They
are chiefly used in surgical operations,
which is justified providing the operation
is justified. One death in three thousand
occurs from the administration of chloroform,
and one in thirteen thousand from
the administration of ether. These
products have been used to some extent
in patent medicines, particularly in consumptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
cures, where they have been
given with the idea of relieving the
cough.</p>


<h4>POISONOUS MINERAL SALTS AND ACIDS</h4>

<p>The mineral acids and salts of certain
metals, especially of mercury, lead, and
copper, are powerful poisons. Patent
medicines are frequently labeled "Pure
vegetable compounds." This statement
may be true, but it is deceptive because
they are equally as poisonous as the
coal-tar products which have become so
popular. They are life-destroying in
their final effects upon the human body.</p>


<h5>MERCURY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Uses of mercury
and mercurial salts</div>

<p>The metal mercury or quicksilver is
used very extensively as a medicine,
chiefly in compounds of
mercurial salts. All salts
of mercury are extremely
poisonous. Calomel (mercuric chlorid)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
is a standard allopathic medicine. Mercuric
bichlorid or corrosive sublimate is
more destructive to protoplasm, and is
used as a germicide or disinfectant. The
poisonous action of mercurial salts is
probably due to the combination of
mercury with the protoplasm of the body-cells.
When mercurial compounds are
taken in poisonous doses, the antidote is
the white of egg with which the mercury
combines in the stomach, thus sparing
the human protoplasm. The mercurial
salts, when given in small doses, produce
very remarkable physiological disturbances,
sometimes even loosening of teeth.
Because of their violent physiological
action, these drugs are generally to be
condemned.</p>


<h5>POTASSIUM IODID</h5>

<p>Potassium iodid has a very destructive
effect upon the natural functions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
body, and for this reason it has been
associated with mercury in the treatment
of syphilis, the usual method being to
alternate between potassium iodid and
mercurial salts.</p>


<h5>LEAD AND COPPER</h5>

<p>The salts of lead and copper, like
those of mercury, are poisonous. However,
these salts are not extensively used
in medicines. The mineral acids, such
as sulfuric, are recognized poisons, but
their destructive effects upon the living
tissue are so apparent and so painful that
they have never gained favor with physicians.</p>


<h5>PURGATIVES AND CATHARTICS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of salts</div>

<p>The popular term "salts" includes
sodium sulfate (Glauber's salt), and magnesium
sulfate (Epsom salts).
These salts cause a large
amount of watery mucus to
be excreted from the mucous membrane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of the intestines, the physiological purpose
of which is to wash the offending
substances from the body, thus producing
a laxative effect. Were the large doses
usually taken of these salts absorbed
into the blood, death would ensue within
a few hours.</p>

<p>The number of products that are used
for the purpose of relieving constipation
is almost unlimited. Many poisons which
react directly upon the mucous membrane
of the alimentary canal have a
laxative effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why laxatives
cause loss of vitality</div>

<p>Laxative drugs do not act on the body&mdash;the
body acts on the drug because it
abhors a poison, and, in
throwing out the drug, the
food residues of the digestive
tract are also thrown out, regardless of
whether digestion is complete or not.
The rapid loss of vitality and weight
while taking physic is caused by this fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object of this
lesson</div>

<p>In this lesson I have examined only a
few of the many thousand drugs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
general use. I have omitted many drugs
and compounds whose properties and uses
would form interesting information,
but the purpose
of this book is to impart a
knowledge of foods, not a knowledge of
drugs. This lesson, however, is for the
purpose of giving the reader some authentic
information about the standard
drugs and medicines, so that he may form
his own conclusions in regard to the
efficacy of drugs in curing dis-ease. If
the reader will secure at a public library
a copy of the "National Standard Dispensatory,"
the book used by practising
druggists, and scan through its two thousand
pages, he can form some idea of the
limitless number of things, and the complex,
uncertain, and unscientific methods
used in the prescribing and in the dispensing
of drugs.</p>

<h2><a name="LESSON_X" id="LESSON_X">LESSON X</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Importance of Correct Diagnosis and
Correct Treatment</span></h3>


<p>The word "diagnosis" is derived from
two Greek words, "dia," meaning <em>through</em>,
and "gnosis," meaning <em>knowing</em>. It
therefore means literally "through knowledge,"
"to know thoroughly," or, as we
now say, "thorough knowledge." The
old form of the word is still retained in the
very common expression "to know it
through and through."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diagnosis may
be a source of danger</div>

<p>The primary purpose of diagnosis is
to locate a difficulty, to find an internal
disorder that is causing unpleasant
symptoms. It will
readily be granted that this
is only desirable when, after the internal
disorder has been located, we are able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
to do something to correct it; that otherwise
it is of no more importance than to
learn by post-mortem examination what
caused death. Indeed, to know what
the trouble is without knowing how to
deal with it, is a very grave source of
danger, and has caused many a death
through resort to wrong methods. In a
large percentage of cases Nature will heal,
if her processes are not interfered with,
and in all cases she is the real physician;
our only proper office is to supply the
right materials, and to leave her to use
them as she will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True diagnosis,
merely an interpretation
of Nature's language</div>

<p>Correct diagnosis is important because
it is the guide&mdash;the beginning&mdash;the primary
step in the treatment
of dis-ease. Wrong diagnosis
is usually followed by wrong
methods of treatment, while
correct diagnosis simplifies, and points the
practitioner, with certainty, to the interpretation
of Nature's language (symptoms).
With an understanding of these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
the remedy, in most cases, will suggest
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The human body and the
linotype machine compared</div>

<p>The linotype machine that set the
matter you are now reading is composed
of several thousand parts.
The keyboard is operated
by the compositor, in much
the same manner as that of a typewriter,
and the delicate mechanism produces
the metal lines of type ready to be "made
up" in "forms" for the press. Where
several such machines are in use, an
expert machinist is usually employed to
keep them in order. He can take them
apart, study the mechanism at leisure,
and reassemble them, yet it not infrequently
happens that almost insurmountable
difficulties are encountered. What
would be the difficulties, then, if the
machine were enclosed in a case that
could not be opened, with only the keyboard
exposed? What mechanical engineer
in all the world could then make it
work if something went wrong? One who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
could tell from the faulty action just
what the matter was, and correct it from
without, would be looked upon as a
wizard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Belief in the
magical effect of drugs</div>

<p>The human body is incomparably more
complex and delicate than any machine,
yet it is a widespread superstition
that one skilled in the
art of locating disorders (diagnosis)
can, almost invariably, correct
them by the magical effect of drug applications.
This is a superstition with no
more foundation in fact than the parallel
one that a man of vicious character can
be made virtuous by a magical process.
He may turn from vice to virtue in a
moment, but he can become spiritually
strong and wholesome only by growth,
and by conformity to the moral law.
In like manner bodily health comes not
by magic, but by right living, by conformity
to the laws of health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Involuntary functions
are perfectly performed</div>

<p>It is literally true that "the only perfectly
performed functions of the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
are the involuntary or the automatic functions."
Those that are even partly under
the control of the will, such
as breathing, are almost invariably
ill done. The infinite
wisdom is strikingly exemplified
in the fact that the vital functions are
quite independent of our volition except
for "hindrances or ruinous urgence." We
may, and we do hinder them constantly,
and we subject them to "ruinous urgence"
almost continuously. These two facts
are responsible for nearly all the bodily
ills from which we suffer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature's marvelous
methods beyond our comprehension</div>

<p>The marvelous metabolism by which
energy is translated into life, by Nature's
processes, is not only beyond
our control, but beyond our
comprehension. We should
make it an invariable rule, therefore,
never to interfere in any way, but to
confine our efforts to the task of supplying
Nature with material with which to
do her wonderful work, and to an observance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
of the common laws of health and
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The blood-corpuscles
like little workmen</div>

<p>The blood-corpuscles are like millions
or tens of millions of little workmen in
the body, each with a particular
work to do; each on
duty and quickly responsive
to call every moment. When we recognize
the fact that the body is constantly
being broken down and rebuilt; that
every atom of broken-down material
must be floated away in the blood, and
new atoms built in to keep the structure
from deterioration; that all the broken-down
material is poisonous, and must be
eliminated from the body without delay,
we realize that the internal activities are
almost bewildering. When we consider
that all the blood in the body passes
through the heart every two or three
minutes, carrying food to every cell, and
at the same time carrying away the poisonous
products of physical and mental
activities, disposing of them by various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
processes; when we remember that the
supply to every cell is delicately adjusted
to constantly varying requirements; that
all this goes on so quietly and so smoothly
that we are unconscious of it&mdash;when we
remember all this, we begin to have some
appreciation of the Psalmist's exclamation,
"I am fearfully and wonderfully made."</p>

<p>How faithful these little workmen are!
Not for an instant do they leave their
tasks. Verily, they are the sentinels
forever at the portals. In our work, in
our pleasures, they are ever active; in
our sleep, they sleep not. Not for an
instant do they cease watch. Is there a
wound&mdash;be it a great rent or a tiny pin-prick,
they are there in force to repair it,
to wall up the breach and to make it
whole&mdash;swarming to the rent as the
Lowlanders to a break in the dike. Has
a foreign substance penetrated the structure?&mdash;instantly
they set about to expel
it; but if this be impossible, they seal
it in a capsule of impervious integument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
that it may do no harm, or, the least
possible injury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A seeming consciousness
in the automatic action of
the blood</div>

<p>If these little workmen are not conscious
as we know consciousness, at least
their work shows purposeful
action, and when we see an
obvious purpose definitely
carried out by every available
agency, we may be sure there is a
consciousness back of it, whether it be
like ours or not.</p>

<p>But while these workmen are faithful&mdash;while
they will stand to their tasks to
the end, they are limited in their power,
and will break ranks under long-continued
hindrances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The human
body a power-plant</div>

<p>The human body is a power-plant, a
combined engine and boiler, and there
is a close analogy between
this conscious, self-acting
power-plant and the one
that furnishes the power to generate
electricity, or to turn the wheels of a
factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Symptoms compared
with electric light</div>

<p>When your electric lights grow dim,
and the defect is not cured by renewing
the lamps, then you are
convinced that the trouble
is elsewhere. If the lights in
every part of the house are dim, you will
know (if you are a skilful electrician&mdash;a
good diagnostician) that the trouble is
not in the electric nervous system of the
house. It may be between your house
and the electric station, but before taking
the trouble to examine the line, ask those
of your neighbors who are on a different
line, whether their lights are dim. If they
are, you may go to the electric station
with reasonable certainty of finding the
cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The stomach and the lungs
of this leviathan</div>

<p>Suppose we have come to the station
and are commissioned to locate
the difficulty. We go into
the engine room and find
everything in good order.
The engine is a fine piece of mechanism;
it has no loose joints, no leaky valves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
yet it seems to lack power; is overloaded.
Inquiry shows there are no more lights
than formerly, while the service was
satisfactory. You go at once to the
boiler room. It may also be in good
order so far as appearances go, but you
look at the steam gage and find the pressure
is low. "Yes," says the fireman,
"I simply can't keep the pressure up.
I shovel in coal and keep the drafts on so
that I have a roaring fire, but, in spite
of all, my steam pressure runs down."
Look into the furnace (the stomach) of
this leviathan! If the grate-bars are
clean; if there is no accumulation of
ashes, cinders, or clinkers to interfere
with the combustion (digestion) of the
black provender fed to it, you may close
the furnace door and open another. Look
into the fire tubes (the lungs) of the laboring
monster that has shown signs of
weakness! If the fire tubes are clean,
free from soot and dust, the trouble is
not there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">"Scale," like an
irritated mucous lining</div>

<div class="sidenote">"Scale," the
cause of dim light</div>

<p>We have now gone almost the full
course; there is but one place left to
explore and that is closed.
The trouble is inside the
boiler. It is lined with scale
deposited from the water evaporated in
producing steam. This scale, which may
be likened unto an irritated mucous lining
of the stomach, or the intestines, forms
a coating upon the lower inside of the
boiler, and the upper side of the fire
tubes, just as it is deposited on the bottom
of a teakettle, and it shuts out the heat
from the water. The heat being the source
of energy, and the steam only the means
of applying it, the power-plant is crippled.
Seldom does it happen that so great a
thickness of scale is to be found in a
boiler as may be seen in almost every
household teakettle, yet the
effects (symptoms) are found
in the dimmed lights miles
away, and if the difficulty is not
dealt with, it will rapidly increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
until the service becomes intolerably
inefficient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty in dealing
with the "scale"</div>

<p>Had we found the grate-bars choked
with ashes, cinders, and clinkers, and the
fire tubes (lungs) smothered
with soot and dust, we should
have instructed the fireman
to keep them clean and free. This is not
a difficult thing to do, requiring only
careful daily attention, but the scale
inside the boiler is not so easily dealt
with. It is completely enclosed, and there
is no possibility of getting at it except
by extinguishing the fire and letting the
boiler cool&mdash;by making the boiler "dead,"
or "killing" it, as firemen term it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treating the
"dim light" dis-ease</div>

<p>Having diagnosed this case of the
lighting system, starting with the symptoms
of a dim light in a residence
some miles away, and
having located the difficulty
inside of the boiler of the power-plant,
we desire to treat it. The boiler can be
"killed," and the scales removed by going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
into the boiler. It can then be revived
by refilling it with water and rekindling
the fire.</p>

<p>Then, too, let us assume that there are
two boilers, and that we can keep the
plant alive with one; a low ebb of life,
to be sure, but not dead. We will then
cool one boiler at a time, go into it, and
remove the scale, thus restoring the plant
to full efficiency.</p>

<p>This method can be used where the
boiler may be cooled, but as this cannot
be done with the human power-plant, for
the sake of our analogy, let us suppose
that the steam boiler, like the human
body, must always be kept under pressure
that it cannot be "killed" and revived.
What, then, shall be done?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Removing the cause
of the scaly deposit</div>

<p>It is evident that the first thing to do
is to cease the use of water containing the
solution of mineral, which
causes the scaly deposit.
This will prevent the condition
from growing gradually worse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
may be accomplished by distilling the
water before introducing it into the
boiler, or, by using rain-water. As to the
scale already in the boiler, it must be
dissolved, and gradually eliminated, or
remain there. There are many so-called
"boiler compounds" for the purpose,
and every well-informed man in charge
of such a "plant" knows how important
it is to avoid using a compound that may
cause damage to the boiler itself. A
"compound" that would attack the steel,
as well as the scale, would be a desperate
remedy indeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One degree of
variation in temperature
indicates dis-ease</div>

<div class="sidenote">The marvelous
economy of Nature</div>

<p>In the human body something happens
very similar to the deposit of scale in a
steam boiler. But the human
body is a furnace as well
as an engine. It is so intricate
and so delicate that if the temperature
rises or falls one degree above or
below normal, the condition is one of
dis-ease. As food is its fuel, how can we
expect the mechanism to remain in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
if we utterly disregard the body's requirements,
not only as to the character of the
fuel supplied, but also as to the quantity,
especially if we so choke it with fuel that
Nature is unable to burn it up in the vital
processes, and to dispose of the resulting
ashes and cinders? Nature is resourceful&mdash;full
of expedients and makeshifts! If
she were not, the span of life would be
much shorter than it is. As previously
stated, she will seal up a foreign substance
that cannot be expelled, and not only
will she do this with solids that have
penetrated the flesh, but she
will actually build "catch
basins" in the body, called
cysts&mdash;bags, somewhat like a bladder,
in which the excess or refuse that cannot
be eliminated may be impounded, and
the ruin of the body postponed for months
or even for years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">True diagnosis
locates a disorder; also
the causes</div>

<p>The true office of diagnosis is not only
to find the disorder, but to discover also
the conditions that lead to it, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
have a bearing upon it; hence that
diagnosis is faulty which comes short
of this, for the reason
that even if the disorder
be located and overcome,
it will recur if its cause persists, just
as the scale in the boiler will form
again if the causes that produced it are
not removed.</p>

<p>As the blood is the life, as it brings to
every cell life (nourishment), and carries
away death (poisonous by-products of
vital activities in the form of dead matter
to be eliminated from the body); as it
does this by its marvelously rapid circulation
through every cell, it is obvious
that every part of the body will be in a
state of health if the blood itself is pure,
and its supply and circulation such that
every cell is abundantly fed. The supreme
law of health, therefore, may be
expressed in two statements, one positive
and one negative:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Feed the body correctly</p>

<p>2 Do not interfere with the circulation
of the blood</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Both the storing
of fat and the disposing
of waste are expensive
processes</div>

<p>If the blood is not a perfect building
material it is because we have not put
into the digestive mill the
right materials; and if it
is not properly circulated,
it is because the circulation
is impeded by positive constrictions,
or, as is more frequently the
case, because the composition of the blood
is not perfectly suited to the demands of
the vital activities. As a result, much of
the material must be rejected as unusable,
thus involving a great deal of extra work
in disposing of it. If the excessive material
is wholesome, though not at present
usable, it may be packed away for future
use as fat, this being the easiest, and
perhaps the only possible way of disposing
of it in the rush. The builders are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
only overworked, but literally overwhelmed
with excessive and unsuitable
materials&mdash;and why?&mdash;that we may indulge
perverted appetites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Corpulency
considered unhealthy</div>

<p>Even the excessive material packed
away in the wholesome form of fat may,
merely by its bulk, become
an impediment to the circulation.
It not only reduces
the efficiency of the bodily mechanism,
but also is so potent a factor in shortening
life that a corpulent person is likely to be
rejected by an insurance company, even
though his present state of health may
be good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defective circulation
reduces efficiency</div>

<p>A condition often found illustrates
most forcibly the manner in which defective
circulation reduces the
efficiency of the human
power-plant, even as the
scaly deposit impairs the efficiency of the
steam boiler. "That tired feeling" of
which so many complain, is so called
because the person thus afflicted has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
sense of painful exhaustion upon slight
exertion&mdash;is tired all the time. If our
diagnosis shows a state of chronic exhaustion,
and we endeavor to increase the
body-efficiency by increasing the food,
we shall make the same mistake as the
fireman who shovels more coal under a
scaly boiler.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exhaustion,
the accumulation
of body-poisons</div>

<p>Painful exhaustion in a perfectly
healthy body results from violent, or too
long-continued exercise of
a muscle, and if there are
no intervals of rest, excruciating
pain results. The cells are broken
down more rapidly than the resulting
waste can be carried away by the circulation,
hence the body-poisons and pain.
The pain is a symptom, and where the
condition of which it is the index is
temporary, rest soon restores the normal
condition of ease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rest is
imperative</div>

<p>There would be no sense of exhaustion
if the building and the eliminating processes
could be carried on with sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
rapidity concurrently to make good all
the expenditures of mental and bodily
activities. Not only should
we not need rest, but we
should not even need sleep.
The only occasion to stop, then, would
be to take in more fuel (food), and if this
could be taken while the body is in action,
as fuel is fed to the steam boiler, there
would be no necessity to stop. But
apparently both the upbuilding and the
elimination of waste normally lay behind
the demands of even ordinary activity,
so that a given muscle must have very
frequent intervals of rest (every few
seconds), and the organism, as a whole,
must reduce activity to the minimum by
sleep about one-third of the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature's devices
to provide rest</div>

<p>As some of the muscles are used with
practical continuity during the waking
life, Nature resorts to some
very cunning devices to provide
the necessary rest. The
tension upon the muscle of the eye is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
relaxed for an instant in the unconscious
act of winking, but by reason of the
persistence of visual sensation, this does
not interfere with vision. Thus Nature
has always used the principle involved
in the moving picture. The heart must
perform its work every instant, from the
time before we are born until the end, but
each muscle rests about one-third of
every second&mdash;when it relaxes, and the
chamber of the heart expands with the
inrush of blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The body a pile of
mysterious atomic masonry</div>

<p>Nature alone is the builder, and will do
all that should be done if she only has
the proper materials in
proper proportions. We
may well stand in awe and
admiration of her mysterious atomic
masonry, but let us lay no sacrilegious
hand upon her work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Common Disorders&mdash;Their Cause and
Cure</span></h3>

<hr class="r5" />

<h4>HEALTH AND DIS-EASE DEFINED</h4>

<p>Health is that condition of the human
body in which the functions or activities
work together in perfect harmony. Any
serious interference with this condition
we call dis-ease. Dis-ease, therefore, in
its final analysis, is merely the expression
of violated natural law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three fundamental
laws of life</div>

<p>The harmonious working of the life-processes
in the human body depends
upon three things&mdash;(1) nutrition;
(2) motion and (3)
oxidation. Nutrition is the
principal factor that controls the action
of the living cells, for, if the body is kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
up to its one hundred per cent of energy
it will demand a certain amount of motion
or exercise, and this will enforce the
proper breathing (oxidation). We can
see, therefore, that nutrition is the physical
basis of all activities of life.</p>

<p>By nutrition as here used I mean to
include all chemical substances that may
be supplied for the use of the body-cells,
also the sum total of all chemical substances
in solution in the circulating fluid
or blood-plasma which bathes the body-cells.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The phenomenon of death
caused by self-poisoning</div>

<p>The stoppage of the heart beat causes
the nutritive fluids of the body to cease
circulating. The cells are
then no longer supplied with
nutritive material, and the
poisons which they are constantly throwing
off accumulate, cell activity ceases,
and the phenomenon we call death ensues.
Suffocation acts in a very similar manner&mdash;oxygen
ceases to be supplied to the
blood; carbon dioxid accumulates; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
vital fluids cease to flow, and death is the
result.</p>

<p>Dis-ease has been defined to be an
absence of harmonious activity in the
body. It may result from the inactivity
of some particular function. A stomach
which secretes no hydrochloric acid is
abnormal or dis-eased. Again, a dis-ease
may be due to an overdevelopment
of some function, because the man whose
stomach secretes more hydrochloric acid
than digestion requires is as truly dis-eased
as is the man whose stomach secretes
too little.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dis-ease is
partial death</div>

<div class="sidenote">Animals starve
when fed on salt-free food</div>

<p>Dis-ease may also be defined as partial
death, for it is the disturbance or weakening
of functions whose complete
failure we call death.
Starvation illustrates one
side of this process. When nutritive
material ceases to be supplied, the cells
have nothing with which to work, causing
disturbance of function (dis-ease), and
then partial, or complete death. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
man in a desert under a hot sun will
starve for water in one-tenth the time
that he would starve for solid food. Animals
fed on a diet from which all salts
have been chemically removed
will die in a shorter
time than will those from
which all food is withheld. This rather
interesting fact is due to the rapid utilization
of the salts residual in the body
during the digestion and the assimilation
of the salt-free foods taken. The order
in which the withdrawal of nutritive
substances will produce starvation is
about as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 Aerial oxygen<br />
<br />
2 Water<br />
<br />
3 Mineral salts<br />
<br />
4 Organic nitrogen<br />
<br />
5 Carbohydrates<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Examples of
drug poisoning</div>

<p>Poisoning by drugs is an excellent illustration
of dis-ease and death produced
by specific starvation. When
a man takes ether, this substance,
passing to the brain,
immediately interferes with the function
of that organ. Insensibility to pain
results. If ether is taken in larger quantities,
the functions of the brain may be
still further interfered with, and the
nervous control of the heart beat will be
lost, and death will ensue. When castor-oil
is taken into the alimentary canal, the
irritating substances therein contained
inflame the cells of the mucous membrane,
and excite them to abnormal secretion,
thus disturbing the harmony of the
body-activities, and producing dis-ease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific
definition of
dis-ease</div>

<p>The examples here referred to are not
commonly considered dis-ease, because
we know the particular or
immediate cause of the physical
disturbance. Modern
knowledge now shows us that the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
prolific cause of what is commonly known
as dis-ease is but the interference with
cell activities, either by the deficiency or
by the excess of nutritive substances, or
by the presence of irritating and disturbing
poisons. This condition may be
caused by an unbalanced diet containing
too much of certain nutritive elements,
or too little of others, causing surfeiting
on the one hand and starvation on the
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man still in the
childhood state of development</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hunger, thirst,
and taste are Nature's
language</div>

<p>Health is the normal condition, and in
spite of Ingersoll's witticism, it is more
"catching than dis-ease."
Were it not so, the race
would long since have become
extinct. With reference to body-health,
however, we are still in the
childhood stage of development, and the
science, therefore, of building man to his
highest estate&mdash;of lifting his mental,
moral, and physical faculties to their
highest possible attainment, is worthy
the labor of the greatest minds. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
person, then, who enjoys the best health,
the keenest mentality and power of perception,
the highest physical and emotional
organism, is he who can select such
articles of food as will supply all the constituent
parts of the body most nearly
in the right or natural proportions. The
science of feeding, upon which this mainly
depends, becomes possible only when
food is taken in accordance with certain
fixed, natural laws. These laws are not
complicated&mdash;they are simple and easy
to comprehend. Nature is constantly
endeavoring to aid us in their solution.
Hunger, thirst, taste&mdash;all the
instincts and natural desires
of the body are merely
Nature's language. To interpret this
language, and to obey the laws it lays
down is man's highest duty to himself
and to his race.</p>

<p>There are very few true dis-eases.
Nearly all of the abnormal physical
expressions given off by the body can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
be traced to a few primary causes, and
most of these causes can be removed by
ascertaining and removing other causes
that precede them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classification
of dis-ease, a
matter of convenience</div>

<p>The classification of dis-eases is merely
a matter of convenience, and is of no
practical importance between
the food scientist and the
patient. It merely enables
the one who has studied these classifications
to convey his knowledge or information
to the lay mind.</p>

<p>The dis-eases which will most interest
the student will be those caused by a
lack of nutrition, or by a surfeit of nutrition;
that is to say, a form of starvation
caused by a lack of certain nutritive
elements, and overingestion caused by
an excess of certain other nutritive
elements.</p>

<p>The only practical method of describing
dis-ease is by indicating the organs
afflicted and the impairment of their
functions. Beginning with the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
in which, as previously stated, originates
probably ninety-one per cent of all human
disorders, I will first take up the question
of the abnormal action of food caused by
overeating.</p>


<h4>OVEREATING</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The resourcefulness
of Nature</div>

<p>Fortunately Nature does not demand
exactness. She has made wonderful provision
for our errors or our
lack of precision. If we eat
too much now and then she
will cast out the excess. If, however, we
habitually overeat, she will store away
the surplus in the form of useless fat, or
she will decompose it; that is, make an
effort to volatilize it and cast it out
through the pores of the skin. If our diet
is unbalanced, Nature has the power to
convert one chemical into another&mdash;a
secret yet unknown to modern science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Injurious effects
of congested waste matter</div>

<p>While the tendency of Nature is to
maintain normality by casting the debris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
out of the body, she demands that we obey
the laws of motion and oxidation. If we
do not observe these laws,
the debris or matter she
cannot use will accumulate,
and congestion and constipation will take
place. The excess of food thus actually
clogs the system and generates in the intestines
the poisons which cause autointoxication.</p>


<h5>THE EFFECTS OF OVEREATING</h5>

<p>The effects of overeating are so far-reaching,
and so common among civilized
people that a volume might be devoted to
this habit and the subject not exhausted.
Here, however, I will review only that
which is of most importance to the
student of dietetics, namely, the causes
and a few of the effects of overeating.</p>

<p>Overeating is due to three specific
causes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Eating several articles of food
at the same meal which are
incompatible</p>

<p>2 Taking stimulants at meals</p>

<p>3 Eating too many things at the
same meal</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) Incompatible foods:</p></blockquote>

<p>When foods are eaten together that
are incompatible they usually result in
superacidity and sometimes cause a
gnawing sensation in the stomach.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(2) Stimulants with meals:</p></blockquote>

<p>When one takes stimulants such as
beer, liquor or wine with meals, the
stomach-cells secrete a deficient amount
of hydrochloric acid, causing food to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
leave the stomach too slowly, thereby allowing
fermentation to take place and
acid conditions to develop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3) Too many things at same meal:</p></blockquote>

<p>Too many things eaten at the same
meal may exhaust the digestive juices
and cause a condition of subacidity (lack
of acid), which is true indigestion, or it
may cause just the reverse, too much
acid, and therefore produce the same
result as in taking stimulants with meals.
(See "Causes of Superacidity," item 2,
p. 420).</p>


<h5>ABNORMAL APPETITE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">The cycle of
cause and effect</div>

<p>In nearly all cases of overeating Nature's
only weapon with which to defend
herself is hydrochloric acid,
thus the stomach-cells become
over-trained in the secretion
of acid, and the constant irritation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
caused by acid fermentation produces
abnormal appetite. The desire to satisfy
this abnormal craving produces more acid,
therefore the cycle of overeating and
superacidity is complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disorders
originating in the stomach</div>

<p>Standard medical works give about
sixty different disorders arising from
what is termed dis-eases of
nutrition. These include
diabetes, gout, arthritis,
rheumatism, rickets, scurvy, obesity, emaciation,
adiposis dolorosa, and various
disorders of the liver, heart, and the circulatory
system; also constipation and
dozens of disorders under the broad term
of autointoxication.</p>

<p>The first step in the practise of scientific
eating should be to limit the quantity
of food, or, in many cases, to take
a complete fast for a brief time.</p>

<p>In the slow stages of human development,
Nature seems to have accommodated
herself to man's omnivorous habits
of eating. She will accept many things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
that are wholly unfit for food without
apparent harm if the quantity is not too
great. On the contrary, the results of
the most scientific dieting will be injurious
if a quantity be taken in excess of
that which the body can use.</p>


<h5>SUPERACIDITY</h5>

<p>We will first consider superacidity
because it is usually the first disorder
that appears in consequence of wrong
eating. It is commonly known as "sour
stomach."</p>

<p>The chief cause of superacidity is a
wrong combination of foods; and particularly
an excess of starchy foods and
sugars. The starch and sugar breaks
down under the action of fermentation,
and develops lactic acid. This further
inhibits&mdash;or prevents&mdash;the normal secretion
of hydrochloric acid, and, as a consequence,
the albumen molecule is insufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
converted&mdash;the transformation
of the protein into peptones and proteoses
is incomplete.</p>

<p>As with all acid fermentation, gases
are produced in the stomach, which give
rise to belching and eructations. This
fermentation sometimes occasions a feeling
as though there were a solid lump
in the stomach. This may come on immediately
after eating. And then again,
it may not come on for two or three
hours after the meal&mdash;depending entirely
upon the activity of the enzymes
that are responsible for the fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>


<h4>HYPERCHLORHYDRIA</h4>

<p>Occasionally the hyperacidity is caused
by the presence of a superabundance of
hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This
condition is called hyperchlorhydria, and
gives rise to a boring, gnawing sensation
in the pit of the stomach, together
with an abnormal desire for food.</p>


<h5>SUPERACIDITY&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The chief causes of superacidity are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Too great a quantity of food</p>

<p>2 Wrong combinations and wrong
proportions of food</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance, a diet consisting
of an excess of acid
fruits, or sweets and starches,
and at the same time an insufficient
quantity of other
nutrients</p>

<p>3 By poisoning from the use of
tea or coffee, liquor, tobacco,
and the various stimulating
and narcotic drugs used by
civilized man</p>

<p>4 An excess of hydrochloric acid</p></blockquote>


<h5>SUPERACIDITY&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>So far as the symptoms are concerned,
all the above causes may be considered
together, since the ultimate result is the
same. The symptoms are named in the
order of their various stages or the time
acidity has endured:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Irritation of the mucous lining
of the stomach, expressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
a burning sometimes called
"heartburn"</p>

<p>2 Abnormal appetite caused by the
irritation of too much hydrochloric
acid in the irritated
cells of the stomach</p></blockquote>

<p>Many people mistake these
symptoms for evidence of good
health, until overeating produces
nervous indigestion, and sometimes
a complete breakdown.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3 Fevered mouth, and so-called
fever-sores on the lips and
tongue, both of which are a
true mirror of the condition
of the stomach</p>

<p>4 <a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>A sour fluid rising in the throat
from one to two hours after
meals</p>

<p>5 White coating on the tongue</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>6 Faintness, emptiness; in the
language of the layman a
"hollowness and an all-gone
caved-in" feeling</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> (See "Fermentation&mdash;The Symptoms,"
p. 426)</p></div>


<h5>SUPERACIDITY&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>In all cases of superacidity all fruit,
especially that of an acid character, except
citrus fruits, should be omitted, and
also all sweets except a very limited
quantity of maple-sugar and sweet fruits&mdash;and
these never in conjunction with
the meal. Foods containing proteids
(nitrogen, albumin and casein), together
with fresh green vegetables, should form
the principal part of the diet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One acid will
not counteract another</div>

<p>It has been the theory with dietitians
that those afflicted with hyperchlorhydria
(supersecretion
of hydrochloric acid)
should not take sweets, but should take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
acids liberally. This is one of the few
instances in which medical guesswork
seems to have a foundation of fact. For
there is no doubt but that the giving of
hydrochloric acid, the normal stomach
acid, <em>before</em> a meal, tends to retard and
restrict the development of hydrochloric
acid <em>during</em> the meal.</p>

<p>It remains true, on the other hand, that
the giving of hydrochloric acid after the
meal tends always to increase the supply
of free and combined hydrochloric acid in
the stomach during the process of stomach
digestion.</p>

<p>For list of foods to be eaten and
omitted in cases of overeating, superacidity,
fermentation and gas dilatation,
see p. 433. For the importance of water-drinking,
see p. 434.</p>


<h4>FERMENTATION</h4>

<p>Fermentation is the effort of Nature to
dispose of or to dissolve things it cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
use; it is the first step in the process of
decay.</p>


<h5>FERMENTATION&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The common causes of fermentation are
the same as those of superacidity (see
p. 420), the difference being that superacidity
originates in the stomach, and is
confined chiefly to it, while fermentation
may take place throughout the entire
intestinal tract. The causes are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 Overeating<br />
2 Too much acid fruit<br />
3 An excess of sweets<br />
4 Stimulants of the alkaloid group<br />
5 Overeating of cereal products<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>


<h5>FERMENTATION&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Difference between
superacidity and
fermentation</div>

<p>The first evidence of fermentation is a
burning sensation in the stomach, almost
exactly as in superacidity,
the difference being that in
cases of fermentation the
symptoms appear later after eating. Superacidity
may appear immediately after
eating, and the symptoms such as a lump
in the stomach, or a sour fluid rising in
the throat may also appear within an
hour after meals, but fermentation, which
produces the same symptoms, does not
manifest itself until the acid has acted
upon the food, which requires from two to
four hours, governed by the time required
to digest the different articles of which the
meal is composed.</p>

<p>The patient may also experience a fullness;
an unpleasant and sometimes painful
distention of the bowels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of
fermentation</div>

<p>The gas generated by fermentation
sometimes passes along down the intestinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
tract into the ascending colon, accumulating
at the highest point, which is
in the transverse colon. This
causes the transverse colon
to become very much distended
and seriously interferes with the
blood flow, both into and out of the heart
and the lungs.</p>

<p>(See "Gastritis," p. 447; also "Heart
Trouble," p. 569).</p>

<p>In considering the symptoms of fermentation,
it might be well to return to
the question of causes. The primary
cause of nearly all conditions of fermentation,
either in the stomach or in the
intestinal tract, is overeating, or an unbalanced
dietary.</p>

<p>This practise indulged in from day to
day causes two specific conditions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">1 Fermentation followed by various
disorders, usually toxic
substances, and catarrh, and
ulceration of the stomach</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">2 Intestinal congestion and physical
emaciation</p></blockquote>

<p>If the stomach and other digestive
organs are capable of assimilating this
superabundance of food, they force into
the tissues an excess which Nature stores
up in the form of fat, and if work or activity
is not increased, or the food
diminished, excessive fat or chronic obesity
is the result.</p>

<p>If the first warnings are not observed,
and the remedy applied, Nature gives
to the disobedient one more impressive
signals in the form of nervousness, irritability,
abnormal appetite, and sometimes
mental depression, which indicates
one of the most advanced stages of superacidity.</p>


<h5>FERMENTATION&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The remedy for fermentation is first
to eat only such foods as are in chemical
harmony, and second to limit the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
to the actual needs of the body. If
the patient is <em>under</em> normal weight, all
acid fruits should be eliminated, and the
diet should be about as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">BREAKFAST</p>

<p>Three or four egg whites and one yolk, whipped
five or six minutes; add a large spoonful of sugar
and one of cream while whipping</p>

<p>A baked white potato or boiled wheat</p>

<p>A tablespoonful of wheat bran</p>

<p class="center">LUNCHEON</p>

<p>One whole egg whipped five minutes; add
sugar and cream to taste while whipping, mix
with a glass of milk</p>

<p>A large boiled onion</p>

<p>A baked potato, with butter</p>

<p>Two tablespoonfuls of bran</p>

<p class="center">DINNER</p>

<p>Two fresh vegetables&mdash;choice of carrots, corn,
turnips, peas, beans, or squash</p>

<p>Spinach, or a salad of lettuce and celery</p>

<p>The whites of two or three eggs, whipped;
add sugar and cream while whipping</p>

<p>A baked potato</p>

<p>Wheat bran, cooked as a cereal</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>From two to three glasses of cool water
should be drunk at each meal.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this bill of fare is
composed largely of vegetables, which is
right in cases of fermentation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Despondency,
the result of superacidity</div>

<p>The foods named in the above menus
will remove the primary causes of fermentation,
which in turn is the most prolific cause of
that abnormal mental condition
called despondency. Under the most
favorable social and financial conditions,
when every environment is pleasant and
seemingly conducive to the highest degree
of pleasure and interest in life, the one
afflicted with superacidity and fermentation
has been known to destroy himself;
all life seems gloomy, all effort useless,
and the thought "Why should I desire
to live?" enters the mind unbidden, until
it often takes tangible shape in some rash
act. Possibly within the memory of
every individual one of these rash acts
can be recalled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>The practitioner should make it a
special point to ascertain any adverse
or depressed mental conditions of his
patient and remove them, if possible, by
encouragement, sympathetic counsel and
optimistic views, all of which have a
splendid psychological effect, and which,
in nearly all cases of mental depression,
are very important.</p>

<p>As the supersecretion of hydrochloric
acid becomes less and less, fermentation
will gradually disappear; the patient
will at once begin to gain weight; the
mental conditions will show an immediate
improvement, and every part of the
anatomy will share in the general upbuilding.</p>


<h4>GAS DILATATION</h4>

<p>So closely related are gas dilatation,
fermentation and superacidity that it
might be said they all come from common
causes, such as excessive eating, over-consumption
of sweets, acid fruits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
starches, and the use of tobacco, stimulating
beverages and drugs.</p>


<h5>GAS DILATATION&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of gas dilatation are
practically the same as those given for
fermentation, page 426. In addition
thereto, however, there is often belching,
loss of appetite, a weighty or draggy
feeling, and vomiting sometimes an hour
or two after meals, or late at night.</p>

<p>Scanty urine and constipation are frequently
the results of gas dilatation. In
severe cases the stomach drops down
below its normal level, causing permanent
stomach prolapsus.</p>

<p>To the trained eye, in severe cases,
the stomach may be outlined, especially
when it is much distended.</p>

428.</p>

<h4>IMPORTANCE OF WATER-DRINKING</h4>

<p>The lack of body-moisture is one
of the causes of supersecretion of
acid, therefore water is of primary
importance in removing the causes
of the above disorders. It should
be drunk freely immediately on
rising, and just before retiring.
From two to three glasses should
also be drunk at each meal, especially
in treating severe cases.
Copious water-drinking also relieves
irritation of the stomach,
thus reducing abnormal appetite.</p>

<p>Patients afflicted with superacidity
never have natural thirst.</p>


<h4>CONSTIPATION</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>This disorder might be called "civilizatis,"
so universal has it become among
civilized people.</p>

<p>Several conditions may conspire to
cause constipation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Premature stomach digestion</p>

<p>2 Neutralization of the bile by
excessive acid</p>

<p>3 Eating too much starchy food</p>

<p>4 Flesh-eating</p>

<p>5 Sedentary habits or lack of
proper exercise</p>

<p>6 A diet too refined&mdash;lacking in
roughness, cellulose or "fodder"</p>

<p>7 The use of sedatives, stimulants,
and narcotics, such as tea,
coffee, liquor, tobacco, and
drugs, especially of the alkaloid
group</p></blockquote>

<p>While most of these are direct causes,
the primary cause, however, goes back
to superacidity&mdash;premature stomach-digestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>In cases of superacidity the liver is
nearly always more or less inactive.
Just why this is so is not definitely known,
but in the opinion of the writer it is
caused by the neutralization of bile by
the excess of acid. Be this as it may,
nearly all cases of superacidity are accompanied
by intestinal congestion,
commonly called constipation, or by
intermittent diarrhea and constipation.</p>


<h5>CONSTIPATION&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Laxative
drugs an offense
to the body</div>

<p>It is believed by the medical profession,
and generally accepted by the public,
that certain drugs act upon
the alimentary tract with
beneficial effect in cases of
intestinal congestion. This
is untrue. The facts are the intestines
act upon the drug. The drug is an offense
to Nature, and when it is taken into the
stomach and passed on to the intestines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
the body-fluids are severely drawn upon
to neutralize the poison, and to cast it
out. The result, therefore, of taking
poisons, miscalled "laxatives," is that
each time the act is repeated, the liver
and the peristaltic muscles are weakened,
and rendered more and more abnormal,
and less and less able to perform their
natural functions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestions
for the relief
of constipation</div>

<p>That system of treatment which has
been prescribed for fermentation will,
in most cases, relieve constipation.
The treatment should be varied, however,
according to the age and the occupation
of the patient, governed by the season
of the year, or the foods available at the
time of treatment. If diagnosis of the
patient reveals the fact that constipation
has been caused primarily by overeating,
the quantity of food should be reduced,
and the articles changed so as to include
a generous quantity of cellulose (coarse
foods).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The following bill of fare may be
given under ordinary conditions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Immediately on rising, take two
or three cups of water, the juice
of one or two oranges, or half
a pound of grapes, swallowing the
seeds and pulp whole, masticating
only the skins. Devote from eight
to ten minutes to vigorous exercise,
especially movements Nos. 3 and
5, as shown in "Exercise and Re-creation,"
Vol. V, pp. 1344 and 1345.</p>

<p class="center">BREAKFAST</p>

<p>Half a cup of coarse wheat bran, cooked ten
minutes; serve with thin cream</p>

<p>Whole wheat, boiled five or six hours</p>

<p>One or two very ripe bananas, with either nuts
or thin cream</p>

<p class="center">LUNCHEON</p>

<p>One or two fresh vegetables</p>

<p>A "two-minute" egg or a very small portion
of fish</p>

<p>A heaping tablespoonful of bran</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">DINNER</p>

<p>Two of the following vegetables: Corn, carrots,
peas, beans, parsnips, turnips, onions</p>

<p>A baked potato</p>

<p>Celery, lettuce, or anything green, with nuts</p>

<p>One egg</p>

<p>A tablespoonful of wheat bran</p>


<p>From one to two glasses of water
should be drunk at each of these
meals.</p></blockquote>

<p>These menus are merely suggestive.
They may be varied according to judgment,
depending upon the habits and the
environments of the patient. Curative
feeding for constipation is one of the
most important departments of this work,
and will receive special consideration
in the volume of Menus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk may be
laxative or constipating</div>

<p>Whether or not milk is constipating
depends entirely upon how it is taken,
and the articles with which
it is combined. In small
quantities, from one to two
glasses at a time, milk is constipating.
However, if taken at intervals of fifteen
or twenty minutes, a quantity is very
soon taken, greater than the hydrochloric
acid of the stomach can convert into
curd, therefore the surplus quantity becomes
rather laxative. In many years'
experience I have rarely treated a case
of constipation that would not readily
yield to milk and to coarse vegetables, or
bran, if taken in this way; however, the
milk diet should not be given longer than
two or three days at one time. After this
period adopt the menus herein given,
varying them by selecting different articles
from the several groups named.
When the bowel action has become
regular, the milk period should be reduced,
and the breadless diet extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
until the milk is entirely withdrawn.

<div class="sidenote">Hernia due to
abdominal pressure</div>

<p>Man undoubtedly sprang from anthropoid
stock. His original position of locomotion
was upon his four
feet. The intestines, therefore,
rested upon a flexible
belly surface, but since he has risen and
changed his two front paws into hands,
the intestines are inclined, with every
step, to sag to the bottom of the abdominal
cavity, and are prevented from so
doing only by small ligaments attached
to the abdominal walls. Hernia or rupture
is exceedingly common owing to this
downward pressure in the lower part of
the abdominal cavity. The position maintained
while walking, therefore, is not
conducive to the relief of that pressure
in the abdomen, which is the direct cause
of hernia, and often the cause of very
stubborn intestinal congestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedial and
counteractive exercises</div>

<p>It is obvious, therefore, that this condition
needs remedial exercise. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
observed that all the movements given in
the lesson on "Exercise and Re-creation"
bring the trunk to a horizontal
position with the
body leaning forward. All of
these movements are designed to counteract
this abdominal pressure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercise a necessity
in counteracting constipation</div>

<p>I go thus into detail for the purpose of
showing the great necessity of these
exercises, especially in cases
of constipation, and of insisting
that they be executed
vigorously and regularly. <em>The most beneficial
diet that could be prescribed will not
relieve and cure constipation unless it is
supplemented by certain remedial exercises
or movements.</em> This is true because Nature
contemplates a certain amount of
motion exactly as she contemplates a
certain amount of nutrition, and her laws
governing motion are just as mandatory
and her penalties just as certain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proper nourishment
promotes natural desire
for exercise</div>

<p>Nutrition is of more importance because
it is more fundamental, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
more fundamental because when the body
is naturally nourished, there is created
a surplus amount of energy
which will compel a certain
amount of motion, and this
in turn will cause deep or
full breathing. Therefore the well-fed
person will take his exercise because he
has an appetite for it, or because the
superabundance of energy forces him to
do it in obedience to the same law that
produces hunger. Hence the perfectly
nourished body will conform automatically
to the other two great physical laws
of motion and of oxidation.</p>

<h4>GASTRITIS</h4>

<p>Gastritis is a word meant to describe
a chronic and a painful condition of
stomach and of intestinal irritation.
When the stomach becomes much irritated
from constant fermentation of food,
and from the resultant presence of acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
certain articles such as milk, fruit-acids,
and starchy foods will cause rapid accumulation
of gas, which becomes exceedingly
painful and sometimes dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gas, the primary
cause of heart trouble</div>

<p>The majority of deaths from so-called
heart-failure is caused directly by the
accumulation of gas from the
fermenting mass of food in
the stomach and in the intestines.
These organs become greatly
inflated, and their pressure against all
the vital organs, and against the arteries
leading into and out of the lungs and
the heart so impair the circulation that
the heart action becomes very irregular&mdash;first
slow and faint; sometimes skipping
a beat, and again violent and palpitating.
When the congested blood spurts through
into the heart it is called "arterial overflow,"
and the old diagnostician seems
to have been content with giving this a
name. It is certain they have not yet
given the world a remedy, as the regular
profession is still prescribing such drugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
as bicarbonate of soda, bismuth subnitrate,
and nux vomica, none of which can
give more than temporary relief, and that
is accomplished by neutralizing the acid
at the tremendous expense of the cells
that secrete it.</p>


<h5>GASTRITIS&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>Gastritis is caused:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 By the use of stimulants</p>

<p>2 Irritating foods, condiments, etc.</p>

<p>3 Overeating, especially of acid
fruits, starches and sweets</p>

<p>4 Cirrhosis of the liver is sometimes
one of the secondary
causes of gastritis</p></blockquote>


<h5>GASTRITIS&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms are usually a dull pain
in the region of the stomach and upper
intestines, a swollen full feeling, now and
then biting pains, followed by a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
vomit, especially when the attack comes
late at night.</p>

<p>Gastritis is often confused with gastric
cancer, and in diagnosis it is difficult to
speak with authority as to whether the
case is ordinary gastritis, as above described,
gastric ulcer, or gastric cancer.
The diagnostician in making up his
opinion must be governed largely by the
time the condition has endured, and the
immediate causes, giving especial care
to the food and drink that has been consumed
just prior to the attack.</p>


<h5>GASTRITIS&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>In severe cases the patient should be
given a glass of cool water. In fact,
one of the best means of allaying the
inflammation of gastritis&mdash;or as a matter
of fact any other inflammation&mdash;is
cool water.</p>

<p>All food should be omitted for at least
twenty-four hours, then the patient should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
be given vegetable juice prepared as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Grind spinach, carrots, squash,
or turnips, any two or three of
these, very fine; cook about ten
minutes in enough water to make
a pint of thin vegetable soup. Put
through a colander; strain through
a coarse cloth, discarding the pulp.
Give this to the patient every
two hours in quantities not more
than one or two ounces, dependent
upon the condition.</p></blockquote>

<p>The diet may be varied by changing
vegetables, always selecting one green
plant such as spinach, lettuce, beet or
turnip-tops. As the patient improves
more of the pulp may be used. After
the second or third day a thin puree
may be used, care being exercised not
to overfeed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foods to be
used in the treatment of
gastritis</div>

<p>In milder cases the patient should be
fed after the same methods, only more
of the vegetable pulp may be used, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
increasing the strength of the diet after
four or five days; or, when the patient
shows signs of substantial
recovery, egg whites, baked
potatoes, and the ordinary
fresh vegetables may be given in moderate
quantities.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as stomach fermentation is
the beginning or parent cause of gastritis,
the causes, symptoms, and menus given
for fermentation would apply in cases of
gastritis, limiting the quantity of food
according to the severity of the condition.</p>

<h4>NERVOUS INDIGESTION</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Mental effects
of nervousness</div>

<p>There are millions of nerve fibers leading
out from the stomach and alimentary
tract to every part of the
anatomy, so that the nervous
connection, especially between
the stomach and the brain, is very
direct and sensitive. The stomach seems
to bear the same relation to the brain
that a basket bears to a balloon so far
as their nervous connection is concerned.
Thus it is that the irritated stomach
produces an irritable temper, insomnia,
forgetfulness, and a lack of ability to
concentrate the thoughts. These are
the milder symptoms or first warnings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>


<h5>NERVOUS INDIGESTION&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The use of stimulants or narcotics,
such as tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco
are most prolific causes of nervousness.
These drugs act upon the body in a dual
capacity: (1) They excite or raise the
nervous system above normal, only to
drop it below when the reaction takes
place. (2) In addition to this, they irritate
the stomach and the intestines by
causing superacidity.</p>

<p>Nervousness caused by sedatives and
narcotics acts both upon the mental and
the physical organism, and the source
of such nervousness can be easily traced
by ascertaining the habits of the patient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abnormal appetite
for sweets and starches</div>

<p>When the patient has used stimulants
and narcotics long enough to cause
nervousness, the mucous
membrane of the stomach is
usually in a state of irritation.
The presence of blood, under these
conditions, causes abnormal appetite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
frequently followed by overeating, especially
of sweets, starches, and acids, for
which the patient usually has a great
craving. This is followed by fermentation,
and comes into or envelops superacidity
and must necessarily be classed
with it.</p>

<p>Overeating and the constant use of
stimulants and narcotics will, after a time,
cause a chronic state of fermentation,
and the stomach will seldom be free from
acid, the constant presence of which will
ultimately cause gastric ulcer, and perhaps
stomach carcinoma.</p>


<h5>NERVOUS INDIGESTION&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Nature's final
symptoms</div>

<p>The more advanced stages of stomach
irritation which are expressed by nervousness
cause melancholia
and a gloomy sort of pessimism.
These are among the
last signals the stomach gives to the brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
before final collapse, and if these signals
are not heeded, the victim may expect to
go down in the maelstrom of nervous
prostration within twelve months from
the time the first signals are given. These
fits or spells of melancholia often come on
suddenly. The palms of the hands become
moist with a cold, clammy perspiration,
and the mind is flooded with a
train of thoughts such as "What's the
use of living?" "Why all this struggle
for mere existence?" The victim of this
condition invariably believes that his
mind is becoming affected; that he is
becoming insane, and will soon be a
public charge, and shunned by those
whom he loves. While under these spells
many people take their own lives rather
than face what they believe to be insanity
and ostracism.</p>

<p>The patient should be made acquainted
with his true condition, and shown that
it is only temporary, and that all such
thoughts are mere mental aberrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
which will disappear when the causes of
stomach irritation are removed.</p>

<p>The above-named symptoms always
point with certainty to an irritated
stomach, the severity of which can be
determined by the symptoms above described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference between
stomach and intestinal
irritation</div>

<p><em>Stomach irritation</em> is expressed largely
through the <em>mind</em>, as in irritability, nervousness
and melancholia,
while <em>intestinal irritation</em>
is generally expressed by
some <em>physical symptom</em>, such as restlessness,
twitching of the muscles
and a general lack of physical tranquillity.</p>

<p>There is another form of nervousness
believed to be caused by overwork, business
worries, etc. With these opinions
the writer does not agree. If the body is
properly fed one is not likely to overwork.
Nature will demand rest, and sleep
will come while at the desk, or when
following the plow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Acidity the
cause of worry</div>

<p>Investigators are much divided on the
question of whether worry causes superacidity,
or superacidity
causes worry. The experience
of the writer in treating
several thousand cases of stomach acidity
has proved beyond a doubt that acid
fermentation and stomach irritation are
the primary causes, and what is commonly
called "worry" is merely a symptom
or result of this condition. It is quite
evident, therefore, that all forms of nervousness
must go back to the food
question for final solution.</p>


<h5>NERVOUS INDIGESTION&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>Nervous indigestion should be treated
as follows:</p>

<p class="noind">1 The patient should employ his

<p>The experience of the writer for many
years has been that the <em>fewer the articles
composing the diet, the better the progress
could be made in treating nervous indigestion.
In many instances, the mono-diet
system (eating only one kind of food at a
meal) has been adopted with excellent
results</em>.</p>


<h4>SUBACIDITY</h4>

<p>Indigestion is a term used to describe
the condition caused by food remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
in the stomach <em>over</em> Nature's time-limit.
In such cases there is usually a lack of
hydrochloric acid. This disorder is sometimes
called hyperchlorhydria. The expression
of indigestion, which is a lack of
acid, and the expression superacidity or
hyperchlorhydria, which is too much
acid, are often confusing, inasmuch as
both conditions cause a feeling of heaviness
or a lump in the stomach. (See
"Superacidity," p. 419.)</p>


<h5>SUBACIDITY&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The most prolific cause of subacidity
is sedentary habits or lack of activity.
This is especially true of young people,
while in adults, or those who have passed
forty, the usual cause is incorrect eating,
or an unbalanced diet.</p>

<p>Another cause of subacidity is the
overconsumption of flesh foods. Flesh
requires considerable acid for dissolution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
sometimes more than is normally supplied
by the stomach, and consequently results
in indigestion or non-dissolution.</p>

<p>The over-consumption of either starchy
foods or sweets may produce the same
result. It is therefore obvious that this
particular disorder is caused primarily
either by overeating or by an unbalanced
dietary.</p>


<h5>SUBACIDITY&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">1 Brown coating on the tongue&mdash;</p>

<p>The <em>white</em> coating on the
tongue always indicates too
much acid, hence predigestion;
while the <em>brown</em> coating indicates
insufficient acid, hence
indigestion. The <em>white</em> coating
shows the action of the acid on
the stomach lining, while the
<em>brown</em> coating shows the decomposition
of food matter in the
stomach, usually accompanied
by an offensive breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">2 Gas in the stomach&mdash;</p>

<p>Gas sometimes appears in the
stomach immediately after eating.
This shows that food, in a
state of fermentation, remains
in the stomach from a previous
meal. It also shows that the
stomach may be prolapsed; that
is, dropped down below its normal
level. A sort of pocket is
thus frequently formed in which
a small quantity of food remains
from one meal to another, causing
an immediate formation of
gas after eating.</p></blockquote>


<h5>SUBACIDITY&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The logical remedy is to limit the
amount of food to the actual requirements
of the body, and especially to
balance the daily bill of fare in conformity
to the chemistry of nutrition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet in cases
of subacidity</div>

<p>In cases of chronic indigestion or impoverished
acid secretions, it often becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
necessary to prescribe a counteractive
diet, the composition of which should
be determined by the cause
of the disorder. If the
cause be over-consumption
of meat, the patient should be given a
breakfast of acid fruits, and nuts and
salads; while if the cause be over-consumption
of starchy foods, all legumes
and grain products of every kind should
be omitted, and a diet of subacid fruits,
an abundance of green salads, and even
some flesh now and then, such as tender
fish or fowl, should be prescribed.</p>

<p>In all cases the special object should
be to prescribe an amount of food for
the first few days somewhat below the
normal requirements of the body, and
after the counteractive diet has been
taken for three or four days, the menu
should be balanced daily as to nutritive
elements. By observance of these rules,
together with a reasonable observance of
the laws of exercise, fresh air and deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
breathing, the most obstinate cases of
indigestion or subacidity can be overcome.</p>

<h4>BILIOUSNESS</h4>

<p>Biliousness is the supersecretion of bile;
that is to say, more of this fluid is secreted
by the liver than is required for the
ordinary processes of digestion, and the
excess passes into the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>


<h5>BILIOUSNESS&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>Biliousness is caused, in a majority of
cases, by the overconsumption of fats,
milk, eggs, and sweets, or by taking
stimulants, especially such as malted or
brewed liquors.</p>


<h5>BILIOUSNESS&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The presence of bile in the stomach
interferes with the stomach-secretion,
thus causing faulty digestion and severe
headache, usually starting at the back
of the head and ending in a severe pain
over the eyes. The complexion becomes
sallow and there is a general decline in
strength and vitality.</p>


<h5>BILIOUSNESS&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The logical remedy is to remove the
above causes by eliminating from the
diet such articles as tea, coffee, distilled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
brewed and malted liquors of every
character, and sweets, selecting such
foods as will give to the body all the
elements of nutrition, and so combining
them as to furnish these elements in the
right proportions.</p>

<h4>CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>Cirrhosis of the liver, or Hanot's Disease,
is a condition characterized by degeneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
of the liver cells, usually associated
with a fatty infiltration.</p>

<p>While there are many conditions that
may cause cirrhosis, the principal one,
perhaps, is excessive indulgence in alcohol.
Thus the disease is frequently called
"hob-nailed liver," "gin-liver," etc.</p>

<p>Cirrhosis of the liver is a disease that
is almost invariably fatal in from one to
two years&mdash;although, if the process is not
far advanced, and the cause is removed,
the patient may recover tolerable health.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary that further
irritation of the liver, caused by the
drinking of alcohol, be stopped. Close
attention should be paid to the catarrhal
condition of the stomach and bowels,
which is usually associated with cirrhosis.
(See chapter on Catarrh.)</p>


<h5>CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms are usually pain in the
epigastrium; nausea and sometimes vomiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
in the morning; general loss of
vitality and ambition; sallow complexion.
A dull aching or a throbbing pain
is often experienced, followed by a heavy,
sluggish feeling, especially on rising in
the morning. Alternate constipation and
diarrhea, and enlargement of the liver
are frequent symptoms. In the atrophic
variety, however, the liver shrinks in size.</p>


<h5>CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER&mdash;THE
TREATMENT</h5>

<p>The diet should be nutritious, yet simple,
so as to put as little labor as possible
upon the already impaired digestion.
Fats should be restricted, and starchy
foods should be closely limited, so as
not to set up additional fermentation.</p>

<p>A liberal service of plain wheat bran
should be taken at least twice a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
in order to insure active intestinal peristalsis.</p>

<p>All stimulants, narcotics, sweets, condiments
and irritating foods of every
character should be omitted. The patient
should drink copiously of pure
water at meals, omitting all other beverages.</p>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>Cirrhosis of the liver is always aggravated
by the overconsumption of sweets,
starches, fats and intoxicating beverages.
Sweet and starchy foods should be limited
and intoxicants of all kinds should
be entirely omitted. An abundance of
pure water should be taken at meals.</p>


<h4>PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>Piles or hemorrhoids are usually the
result of chronic constipation; or, they
may occur from violent exercise, or a
shock. The straining at stool when constipated
has a most potent influence
in causing piles, as well as the passage
of hard, dry feces. In both of these cases
the rectal mucous surfaces are torn loose
or detached from the supporting walls,
and the cells fill with blood, thereby
becoming very greatly distended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>


<h5>PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The first symptoms are usually itching
of the mucous membrane of the anus.
In the second stage a bloody discharge
will appear with the feces, and in the
more advanced cases the rectal mucous
membrane will protrude.</p>


<h5>PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS&mdash;THE TREATMENT</h5>

<div class="sidenote">How to relieve
the strain upon the rectal
lining</div>

<p>When it is first discovered that there
is a slight protrusion of the rectal mucous
membrane from the anus,
great care should be taken
in evacuation of the feces.
The first or direct cause of this condition
is usually congestion; that is, the feces
in the rectal cavity forms into a hard
mass. When this condition appears,
just before each evacuation, inject into
the rectum, with a small rectal syringe,
a tablespoonful of olive-oil, followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
a pint or two of lukewarm water, taken
as an ordinary enema, and retain two or
three minutes. Then place the first and
the middle fingers, one on each side of
the anus, and press gently so as to relieve
the strain upon the rectal lining. The
feces, if very hard, can be worked back
and forth until broken up, and evacuation
made easy. By this means I have known
many cases of bleeding piles or hemorrhoids
to be permanently cured.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to cure chronic
cases in which the membrane has been
torn from the walls for many years.
However, Nature never tires of doing
her work of repair, and if these suggestions
are religiously observed, even
chronic cases can be greatly relieved, and
sometimes permanently cured.</p>

<p>For diet, see menus for constipation
and fermentation.</p>

<p>Every night, just before retiring, take
a light enema and retain it over night;
also, take an enema just after rising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>


<h4>DIARRHEA</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>Diarrhea is in reality not a dis-ease, but
a symptom behind which there are always
primary causes, usually&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<p>1 Overeating</p>

<p>2 Irritating condiments</p>

<p>3 Wrong combinations of food at
meals</p>

<p>4 Poisonous laxative drugs</p>

<p>5 Excess of acids</p>

<p>6 Excess of sweets</p>

<p>7 Sometimes nervous excitement</p></blockquote>

<p>Diarrhea caused by the last-named
condition is usually of temporary duration.
Sudden attacks of diarrhea are
often caused by exposure, by changes of
diet, or by the overconsumption of acids
in the form of berries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Errors in eating
the cause of diarrhea</div>

<p>There is no abnormal condition of the
alimentary tract that is more directly
traceable to errors in eating
and drinking than diarrhea
and all forms of dysentery.
This condition is most generally caused
by chronic fermentation, or by the presence
of some non-nutritive or foreign
substance. It matters not whether this
condition comes from the use of poisonous
drugs called laxative remedies, or
from foods containing foreign or non-nutritive
substances, the result is the
same.</p>

<p>The habitual taking of drugs sufficiently
poisonous to cause the intestinal
machinery to exert enough action to
cast them out, is a painful and slow
process of self-destruction. It frequently
happens that the peristaltic muscles become
relaxed and give way completely
from the habitual use of poisonous cathartics,
and chronic diarrhea or dysentery
is the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>


<h5>DIARRHEA&mdash;THE TREATMENT</h5>

<p>In ordinary cases of diarrhea one can
pursue his usual work provided he observes
the suggestions in regard to diet,
given below, but in severe cases one should
avoid labor or exercise, and remain most
of the time in a reclining position. Drink
copiously of pure water, and eat very
sparingly.</p>

<h4>EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT</h4>

<p>Underweight, or lack of adipose tissue,
is a condition with which the practitioner
will often have to deal, as under nearly all
abnormal conditions of the body, called
dis-ease, the first result or evidence is loss
of weight.</p>

<p>The tendency of a perfectly normal
body, after it passes the forty-fifth year,
is to become muscular, or what is termed
"thin." In all countries those who have
lived to a very great age have been
termed emaciated. However, there is a
normal body-weight that can be maintained,
and which indicates normal health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of emaciation</div>

<p>Emaciation is usually followed by general
anemia and a weakening
of nearly all the functions
of the body. The memory,
sight, hearing, all become impaired, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
the taste or appetite usually becomes
keener or more sensitive. This is caused
by irritation of the mucous membrane of
the stomach and the consequent presence
of too much blood therein, the same as
when intoxicating liquors are taken just
before meals.</p>

<p>Overwork, loss of sleep, unbalanced
diet, worry, grief, or a period of extreme
emotional tension, all have a tendency
to disturb and derange the processes of
metabolism. Under these conditions the
body is very likely to lose weight, but
there is always a fundamental cause
which should be discovered and removed.</p>


<h5>EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT&mdash;THE
CAUSE</h5>

<p>There are a number of things which
usually conspire to cause emaciation.
Named in the order of their generality,
they are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical causes
of emaciation</div>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Overeating</p>

<p>2 Superacidity</p>

<p>3 Stomach and intestinal
fermentation</p>

<p>4 Constipation</p>

<p>5 Autointoxication</p>

<p>6 Under-drinking of
pure water</p>

<p>7 The use of tobacco,
coffee and tea</p></blockquote>

<p>All of these things tend to cause malassimilation,
which is the secondary cause
of emaciation. In a majority of cases the
loss of weight begins while the body is
surfeited with food. In fact, it is nothing
uncommon for those suffering most from
this condition to consume from three to
four times the necessary quantity of
food; overeating becomes a habit, and
consequent fermentation and toxic substances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
usually known as autointoxication,
are the results.</p>

<p>The causes of emaciation, according to
most authorities, are impoverished blood
and malnutrition. With these opinions
the writer fully agrees, but the intelligent
reader will naturally inquire&mdash;What are
the causes of impoverished blood and
malnutrition? The answer goes directly
back to the food question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental causes
of emaciation</div>

<p>All mental influences, business, social,
or financial worry, contribute their share
toward physical emaciation,
but when the body is perfectly
nourished it is more
capable of withstanding these drains
because it is made fearless by perfect
health. Behind all forms of business
and financial trouble is the demon "fear,"
and fear rests on the uncertainty of our
ability to provide creature comforts and
necessities; therefore when we have mastered
the science of feeding our bodies,
and have learned how simply and cheaply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
this may be done, the mere possession
of such knowledge does more than all
else to make of us philosophers and
students, eliminating fear and worry of
every kind, as in health the mind is
usually in a state of optimism and
tranquillity.</p>


<h5>EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT&mdash;THE
SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of emaciation, of course,
are so apparent that it is only necessary
to say that when the above-named errors
are corrected, and the following symptoms
are observed, the normal weight can
nearly always be maintained.</p>

<p>So-called cold-sores, fevered lips and
canker-sores on the tongue, intestinal
congestion, torpidity of the liver, slight
headaches, fullness after eating, alternate
constipation and diarrhea, are all
symptoms that point to the causes of
emaciation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>


<h5>EMACIATION OR UNDERWEIGHT&mdash;THE
REMEDY</h5>

<p>Emaciation is sometimes caused by
organic or hereditary dis-eases, but the
usual causes are to be found within the
field of dietetics. The remedy, therefore,
is first to naturalize or normalize the diet
as to quantity, selection, proportion, and
combinations of food.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, those who
come to the food scientist for treatment
will be those who have tried every conceivable
remedy except the natural one,
therefore they come in a chronic state
of emaciation, poisoned by overeating.
Never having been instructed in regard
to diet, exercise, breathing, bathing, or
any other hygienic law, they will, in most
cases, require a counteractive or remedial
diet. There may be a number of supplementary
causes to be considered, but the
most important things for the practitioner
to ascertain are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Time the patient rises</p>

<p>2 Hour the first meal is eaten</p>

<p>3 Of what that meal consists</p>

<p>4 Time the second meal is eaten</p>

<p>5 Of what the second meal consists</p>

<p>6 Time the third meal is eaten</p>

<p>7 Of what this meal consists</p>

<p>8 All mental influences under
which the patient is laboring,
especially fear or worry</p>

<p>9 The condition of the bowels as
to congestion</p>

<p>10 The amount of liquid taken
during the day and at meals</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>In nearly all emaciated cases it will
be found that the patient is suffering
from premature fermentation, intestinal
and stomach gas, and a congested condition
of the bowels commonly known as
constipation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foods that are
necessary in the treatment
of emaciation</div>

<p>The first remedy lies in the selection
and the combination of foods which are
readily soluble and assimilable,
and which contain the
best flesh and cell-building
properties. The chemical properties or
elements most necessary are albumin,
phosphorus, casein, proteids and carbohydrates.
These elements are supplied
best by milk, eggs, nuts, sweet fruits and
coarse cereals, followed by a limited
quantity of fresh green vegetables.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of milk
and eggs in the remedial
diet</div>

<p>The nutriment contained in the egg is
all that is required for the young chick,
while the nutrient contents of
milk is all that is necessary
for the young animal. Therefore
these two articles contain the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
reliable and speedy counteractive elements
known to chemistry, but in dealing
with the adult they should be supplemented
by fresh vegetables, coarse grain,
wheat bran, raisins, and the seeds and
skins of grapes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constipation
must be overcome in
cases of emaciation</div>

<p>It must be remembered that milk has
a constipating tendency when taken in
ordinary quantities&mdash;from
one to two glasses at a meal.
Therefore in laying out the
diet for the emaciated, it is vitally important
to avoid constipation, which
may be done by giving milk during the
first two or three days in quantities
ranging from two and one-half to three
and one-half quarts a day, together with
a liberal quantity of coarse cereal. (See
"Constipation&mdash;The Remedy," p. 436.)</p>

<p>These remedial methods may be repeated
day by day until a substantial
gain in weight is noticed, when the diet
may be normalized&mdash;such articles selected
as will give to the body all the required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
elements of nourishment in the right
proportions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chronic emaciation&mdash;its
cause and remedy</div>

<p>It sometimes happens that the body
is thrown into a chronic state of emaciation
on account of a catarrhal
formation over the mucous
membrane of the intestines,
which closes the "winking valves" that
take up nutriment from the alimentary
tract. In such cases coarse cereal or
wheat bran, the seeds and skins of fruit,
especially grapes, together with milk and
eggs, form the best foods known. The
milk and the eggs may be forced, not only
beyond the limitations of hunger, but
beyond the normal needs of the body.
By thus forcing them for a short period
of time (twenty to thirty days) a physical
"trial balance" can be reached, and the
body brought to its normal weight, which
can be maintained for an indefinite period
of time, if the bill of fare is again balanced
or leveled according to the chemical
requirements governed by the three natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
laws, namely, age, temperature of
environment, and work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet for extreme
constipation in emaciated
cases</div>

<p>There is another condition of chronic
emaciation which, in the beginning,
should sometimes be treated
in exactly the opposite way.
For instance, when the forcing
of casein proteids, albumin and nitrogen
(the principal nutrient elements
in milk and eggs) produces complications,
such as extreme constipation, it becomes
necessary to put the patient on a diet
composed of coarse cellulose articles and
fruit for a period of from three to six
days. This should be done in the
following manner:</p>

<p>Immediately on rising drink two or
three cups of water&mdash;lime-free.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">BREAKFAST</p>

<p class="center">(One hour later)</p>

<p>The strained juice of two or three sweet oranges,
or a bunch of grapes; grapes preferred</p>

<p>A cup of wheat bran, cooked; serve hot, with
thin cream</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LUNCHEON</p>

<p>Plain wheat and an equal quantity of coarse
wheat bran, cooked until very soft; preferably
simmered over night</p>

<p>A salad of celery, lettuce and tomatoes, with
nuts</p>

<p class="center">DINNER</p>

<p>About four tablespoonfuls of boiled wheat;
also one of bran</p>

<p>A baked potato</p>

<p>One fresh vegetable</p>

<p>Drink copiously of water at all
meals.</p>

<p>Just before retiring, eat half a
pound of grapes, when in season.</p>

<p>After the first or second day this
bill of fare may be increased in
quantity, and heavier fruits added,
such as pears, prunes, and very
ripe bananas. After the fourth or
fifth day, a salad and a few of the
lighter vegetables, such as onions,
romaine or cabbage, celery, carrots,
or other fibrous vegetables may be
included.</p>

<p>After the first week the diet
should be composed of fresh vegetables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
coarse cereals, eggs, bananas,
nuts, salads, and wheat
bran.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who are emaciated should drink
an abundance of water immediately on
rising and at meals. They should also
take a sufficient quantity of plain wheat
bran, or grapes if in season (Concord
preferred), eating skins, seeds, and pulp,
in order to keep the bowels in normal
condition.</p>

<p>In cases of extreme emaciation, loss of
appetite, or fermentation, the patient
should, for a time, adopt a diet of milk
and eggs, alternating as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first, second, and third days,
drink from two and a half to four
quarts of milk, in small quantities&mdash;one
glass at a time. For the
next three days, reduce the quantity
of milk, and begin taking six
eggs a day, increasing the number,
until twelve eggs are taken. Alternate
between the milk and the
eggs, for a month or more, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
the patient responds in weight in
a shorter time. When there is a
perceptible gain in weight, and
normal hunger has been restored,
reduce the milk and the eggs, and
add the solid foods already suggested.</p>

<h4>OBESITY OR OVERWEIGHT</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Diet, the governing
law of body-weight</div>

<p>It is generally supposed that obesity
is a natural result of modern civilization.
This theory has no foundation
in fact or physiology.
Man can be genuinely modern
without being obese. The law that
governs the growth and graceful symmetry
of the human body is based upon
dietetics, and the indispensable adjuncts
of diet are exercise, oxidation and elimination.
A body that is filled with vitality
by a perfectly balanced diet will experience
the same appetite for motion or
exercise that it does for food or drink.
Exercise forces more blood to the lungs,
and more thorough oxidation is the result.
The properly fed young animal, whether
brute or human, plays and exercises
involuntarily, and the older animal, adequately
nourished without being overfed,
does not lose its youthful instincts. An
observance of the above laws will prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
the accumulation of an excess of fatty
tissue.</p>

<h4>OBESITY&mdash;THE CAUSE</h4>

<p>A very exhausting treatise could be
written upon the cause of obesity, but,
summing it all up briefly, corpulency is
invariably induced through a direct or
indirect violation of the laws of nutrition,
as exemplified in their wonderful processes
of transforming material called
food into pulsating life.</p>

<p>A combination of commissions and
omissions generally conspire to produce
the obese body. They may be mentioned
in the order of their importance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Overingestion of fat-producing
foods</p>

<p>2 Omission of the proper amount
of motion or exercise</p>

<p>3 Imperfect oxidation (breathing)</p>

<p>4 The overconsumption of fluids</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Obesity
caused by overeating</div>

<p>In every case of obesity, one or more
of these causes are present. If one is
blessed with good digestion
and good assimilation, or, in
other words, if all the nutriment
taken into the body is absorbed
into the tissues, then the quantity must
be regulated by one's work or labor,
otherwise any excess of fat-producing
food is stored up by provident Nature,
contemplating future use; and if it is
not used, by actual work, the result is
a gradual accumulation of fatty tissue.
Again, if a quantity of food commensurate
only with the requirements of mental
labor be consumed, and only ordinary
body-activity indulged in, there is likely
to be a gradual decrease in weight,
because a considerable percentage of
energy is consumed by the mere carrying
on of the vital processes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obesity caused by
drinking malted liquors</div>

<p>The worst form of obesity, however,
is that caused by overconsumption of
fermented wines or malted liquors. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
form of enlarged tissue contributes no
strength whatever to its own support.
It is as much of a dead
weight as a hod of mortar,
and much more useless; in
fact, all forms of obesity are not only
useless weight, but dangerous to life.
The obese body is much more liable to
contagious and infectious dis-eases, and
when once affected, less able to defend
itself than the normal body.</p>


<h5>OBESITY&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The control of body-weight rests upon
three distinct and separate laws, the first
and most important of which is nutrition,
the second exercise, and the third oxidation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The storing of
fat regulated by labor or
activity</div>

<p>While at the outset body-weight may
be controlled by increasing the amount
of activity sufficiently to use
the surplus which Nature is
storing away, if however, the
activity ceases and the surplus is not used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
then the storing process becomes chronic,
and radical remedies both in regard to
dietetics and activity must be applied
in order to bring the body back to
normal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amount of fat
required daily in different
climates</div>

<p>A man of normal weight, say 150
pounds, doing ordinary work in a tropical
country, would not need to
consume more than an ounce
of fat each twenty-four hours,
while the same man in a northern climate,
where the thermometer ranges
from zero to 20 below, could use up,
with similar labor, from three to four
ounces of pure fat daily. Fats, however,
do not produce fat in the human body
unless taken largely in excess of its needs.
Their primary purpose is to keep up the
temperature of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dietetic suggestions
for chronic obesity</div>

<p>Where the weight is only from ten to
fifteen pounds above normal,
a substantial reduction can
be made by merely balancing
the diet, but where the accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
of adipose tissue has become chronic,
and the body has taken on from twenty
to fifty pounds, or more, above normal,
then a diet composed largely of non-acid
fruits and fresh vegetables should be
adopted for a period of from twenty to
thirty days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foods that
produce fat</div>

<p>Carbohydrates, that is to say starch
and sugar, are the principal fat-making
nutrients, and all people inclined
to take on abnormal
weight, as a rule, are very
fond of, and eat an excess of starchy
foods. A great amount of the casein in
milk and the phosphorus in eggs are
converted into fat, especially if a quantity
be taken in excess of the amount used
in effort or work. The fat-producing
staple foods are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
All cereal products<br />
All legumes<br />
Bread<br />
Eggs<br />
Milk<br />
Potatoes<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span></p>

<p>In order, therefore, to remove the
causes of obesity, one must begin with
the diet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foods that
reduce fat</div>

<p>Eliminate meat and animal fat; ascertain
as nearly as possible the amount of
carbohydrates necessary for
each day and take none in
excess of this quantity. This
will stop the accumulation of fatty tissue.
If the body is obese, and a reduction
of weight is desired, the diet should
consist of nuts, fruits, salads, fresh vegetables,
and a very limited quantity of
eggs, omitting starchy foods entirely.
After a week or two of this diet, discontinue
the use of eggs, reducing the diet
entirely to nuts, fruits, fresh vegetables
and salads, which in nearly every case
will bring a very substantial reduction
in weight, even if the patient takes but
little exercise and fresh air. If, however,
he can be induced to adopt the above
diet, and at the same time take two hours'
moderate exercise, either in gymnastics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
or useful labor, with a reasonable amount
of exposure to fresh air, the reduction in
weight will be greater, and the muscular
tissue and vitality will increase.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as fat contributes no item
of strength to its own support, if the
patient will take a reasonable amount
of exercise and fresh air, muscular tissue
will increase in the same ratio that fatty
tissue decreases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How menus for
obesity may be varied</div>

<p>The menus for obesity may be varied
according to the fruits and vegetables
at one's command. Fish
is the one article among
animal food that has much
to recommend it, insomuch that it contains
an excellent form of proteid and
phosphorus. If the taste of the patient
should rebel against natural foods, fish
would supply these elements better than
any form of flesh.</p>

<p>The following articles should compose
the general diet for the obese under ordinary
conditions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p class="noind">
Buttermilk<br />
Eggs or fish&mdash;limited quantity<br />
Fruits<br />
Green salads<br />
Nuts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">{ Such as&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">{</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">{ Squash</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">{ Turnips</span><br />
</p>

<p>The ordinary obese person should adopt
either of the following menus, varying
them according to vegetables in season:</p>

</table></div>

<div class="sidenote">Foods should
be selected according to
vocation</div>

<p>If the patient is doing manual labor,
the proteid foods, such as milk, cheese,
nuts, fish and eggs should be
increased according to the
work. If, however, the labor
is sedative, such as followed by the average
business man, the amounts herein
prescribed are sufficient. The breakfast
should be taken an hour after rising, and
the luncheon early, not later than 12
noon, and the dinner not later than
6 p.m.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>The symptoms during the first two or
three days will be that of weakness and
perhaps hunger, leaving the impression
of under-nourishment. This will disappear
after the third or fourth day, and
strength will not only return to normal,
but the body will feel more energetic
than before, and there will be a marked
increase in the powers of endurance. If
the patient can be induced to "fight it
out" for a week on these lines, favorable
symptoms will develop so fast that the
practitioner will be aided in his work
by the mental conviction of the patient,
and success will be assured.</p>

<h4>NEURASTHENIA</h4>

<p>That disorder of the nerves known as
neurasthenia is expressed in general anemia,
or a breaking down of the nervous
vitality. This does not indicate, however,
that neurasthenia is wholly a dis-ease of
the nerves; it merely means that through
the nerves the symptoms are given to
the brain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neurasthenia
a last or final warning</div>

<p>Neurasthenia is a signal or warning
given by the united voice of all the functions
of digestion, secretion,
and excretion. Therefore,
this disorder does not appear
until the body has given fair warning
in many other ways, and if proper heed
had been given the preceding signals, the
nerves would have performed their functions
without an outcry.</p>

<p>Every so-called dis-ease of the human
body, especially of the nervous system,
is in reality the voice of Nature telling
us of our mistakes, and giving us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
opportunity to correct them. Dis-ease,
therefore, is not an enemy to the race,
but a friend. It is an effort, as it were,
in our behalf, of provident Nature to
prevent race extinction.</p>

<p>Nearly every seeming misfortune with
which we are afflicted can be turned to
our benefit. We never take a step upward
until we are mentally prepared for
it; we never become mentally prepared
until we have passed through a certain
amount and kind of experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education defined</div>

<p>Education reduced to its last analysis
is merely the accumulation and co-ordination
of useful knowledge;
useful knowledge is accumulated
only by and through
the art of comparison. The more experience
we have, the more comparisons
we can make.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ability to make
comparisons, measures,
ability to enjoy</div>

<p>Country-raised people control the great
industries of the city and lead in the
nation's great work because they never
become <em>blase</em>. They have always their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
homely and primitive child life to draw
upon for comparisons. Every good
thing, every invention, every
step forward and upward,
every advancement is appreciated
and realized exactly according to
their ability to compare these things with
their opposites.</p>

<p>If the patient should be suffering from
mental disturbances called worry, he
should be reminded that he is merely a
floating mote in the abyss of space, and
if the matter composing his form should
change from organic to inorganic, from
active to inactive; in other words, if
he should die, the great planets would
move on in their majestic courses and
the cosmic scheme would in nowise be
interfered with.</p>


<h5>NEURASTHENIA&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>Neurasthenia is caused by a violation
of the laws of nutrition, such as overeating,
taking intoxicants, tea, coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
tobacco, stimulating and sedative drugs;
an oversupply of certain elements of nourishment
and an undersupply of others;
failure to eliminate waste; a lack of activity
or motion, and improper oxidation.
These causes removed, nervousness and
all neurasthenic tendencies disappear,
and Nature asserts herself and produces
physical normality.</p>


<h5>NEURASTHENIA&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>Neurasthenic symptoms are excitability,
irritability, mental depression, insomnia,
fatigue, exhaustion, emaciation
and sometimes hysteria, which very often
result in other local disorders, such as
extreme constipation or chronic hyperchlorhydria,
with a tendency toward
weakened sexuality.</p>


<h5>NEURASTHENIA&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>In medical literature there are hundreds
of alleged remedies for nervous
disorders, yet not one of them attempts
to ascertain the causes and to suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
their removal. Drugs only paralyze and
stupify the delicate, sensitive nerve fibers
that are conveying the intelligence to
the brain that something is wrong, and
the average man mistakes this for a
remedy or a cure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unbalanced
diet, a primary cause</div>

<p>In the opinion of the writer, neurasthenia
would be almost impossible if the
body were thoroughly nourished,
and the daily bill of
fare kept level, or, as we
would say in our cash system, "balanced."
But when one labors under
heavy mental strains, especially that
character of burden called worry, and is
not properly fed and nourished, the expenditure
of force on one side and the
lack of supplying it on the other, are
very likely to result in an abnormal
physical condition called neurasthenia.
It is safe to say that all cases of neurasthenia
can be traced to improper nourishment
on the one hand and abnormal
mental tension on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet more important
than rest</div>

<p>The rest cure has been employed quite
successfully for these conditions for many
years, and if the proper diet,
or what might be called a
counteractive or remedial
diet, were employed in all the rest cure
establishments, they undoubtedly would
meet with greater success, but unfortunately
some of the best institutions in the
country&mdash;those best equipped to take
care of neurasthenic patients&mdash;do not
attach any great importance to diet.
This comes, no doubt, from the universal
lack of information concerning the natural
laws governing Food Chemistry, and
their particular application to animal life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestions
for the neurasthenic</div>

<p>Neurasthenic patients should first be
given rest, which means complete or total
diversion from business cares,
worry, financial or social responsibility.
They should
be induced, if possible, to become interested
in some special eleemosynary work;
some "hobby" that has for its purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
the uplifting of people. The best remedy
for the weary or discouraged mind, or
the neurasthenic body, is the praise and
esteem of people.</p>

<p>The suggestions hitherto given for all
kindred disorders will apply in most
cases of neurasthenia. (See also "Nervousness&mdash;Its
Cause and Cure," Vol.
V, p. 1211.) The patient should be
advised to spend at least from three to
four hours a day in the open air and
sunshine, when the weather will permit,
in some quiet way, walking, driving, or
in moderate exercise.</p>

<p>Most important of all is the diet. It
should be balanced according to age,
labor, and temperature of the atmosphere,
and should consist of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Such foods as will cause normal action of the bowels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Green corn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nuts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rich fresh milk</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yolks of eggs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Young beans, peas, or any legume before it hardens</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>Immature starch composes the best
form of carbohydrate food, which is
exceedingly necessary in most cases of
neurasthenia, unless the patient be obese,
in which event it should be reduced to
meet only the requirements of the body,
and nitrogenous foods should predominate.</p>

<p>A passive form of exercise is very
highly recommended, such as all forms
of Swedish or mechanical electrical massage.
In connection with this the body
should be given an olive-oil rub at least
twice a week.</p>

<h4>MALNUTRITION</h4>

<h5>CAUSE AND REMEDY</h5>

<p>Malnutrition is caused mainly by errors
in eating, sedentary habits, and lack of
fresh air. The remedy, therefore, suggests
itself. Level or balance the diet
according to the patient's requirements,
and advise from two to three hours'
vigorous exercise every day, and deep
breathing in the open air.</p>

<p>All the causes as well as the cure of
malnutrition were discussed under the
subject of emaciation. (See "Emaciation,"
p. 477.)</p>


<h4>LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The principal cause of locomotor
ataxia is syphilis, the treatment of which
has not been sufficiently thorough. So,
after lying latent&mdash;sometimes for as long
a period as twenty years&mdash;the disease
breaks out again, the germs (which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
called <i>spirochaeta pallida</i>) assume new
virulence, and attack the nervous system&mdash;usually
the posterior column of the
spinal cord.</p>

<p>Not infrequently, the optic nerve is
also affected, developing what is known
as gray atrophy of the nerves. This
causes a gradual loss of vision, and
finally, relative blindness.</p>

<p>Locomotor ataxia may occasionally be
brought on by long-continued exposures
to wet and cold, injuries to the spinal
column, and by excesses of various kinds.
But its chief origin is in syphilis&mdash;indeed,
most European authorities claim
that this is its only origin.</p>


<h5>LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>Among the earliest symptoms of
ataxia are the so-called lightning or
lancinating pains&mdash;which come on in
paroxyms of varying duration&mdash;lasting
for hours, or even days at a time. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
pains may be burning, tearing, cutting
or boring in their nature&mdash;and usually
affect only the upper half of the body.</p>

<p>There is generally, also, a sense of
constriction in the throat&mdash;as of a choking
by the clutch of a hand&mdash;and sometimes
regurgitation of food, intense pains
around the heart or in the epigastrium&mdash;with
flatulence, eructations, and hiccough.</p>

<p>A very common symptom is the so-called
"girdle," a sensation as though a
rope or band were tightly drawn around
the body at the waist. One of the earliest
noticeable symptoms is the want of
co-ordination&mdash;ataxia. This is most pronounced
in the lower extremities, and is
responsible for the unsteadiness of
ataxics in walking or standing.</p>

<p>The gait in ataxia is staggering&mdash;resembling
somewhat the inco-ordination
of a man under the influence of alcohol,
and there is an exaggerated lifting of
the feet and legs with each step. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
normal "knee-jerk" reflex&mdash;that quick
jerk of the foot and lower leg that follows
a sharp blow struck below the knee
when the leg is held free&mdash;is generally
abolished. In fact, this failure of the
reflexes is usually one of the earliest
diagnostic symptoms.</p>

<p>Later in the disease the sphincters of
the bladder and the anus lose their power
to contract, and there is incontinence of
both urine and feces.</p>


<p class="center">THE IMPORTANCE OF DIET</p>

<p>As with any other disease in which
there are serious trophic changes, and
the generation within the system of
toxic products from food decay, it is absolutely
indispensable in ataxia to observe
the utmost care in the selection of
the diet. The food should be light, but
nutritious&mdash;nourishing and strengthening
the system, without, at the same time,
putting too great a tax upon the organs
of digestion and assimilation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>Particular care should be taken to insure
daily movements of the bowels, and
to see that the kidneys are flushed with
a plentiful supply of water drunk each
day.</p>


<h5>LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The generally accepted opinion among
medical men is that locomotor ataxia is
an incurable disease, and that there is
little or nothing that any form of treatment
can accomplish that will tend to
restore function&mdash;or even to arrest the
course of the disease, and postpone its
fatal termination.</p>

<p>With this opinion I beg leave to differ.
I am convinced that, by the proper regulation
of the diet, limiting the system
only to that which it requires for its
complete nourishment&mdash;giving ample
quantities of those foods that are rich in
lecithin (or nerve-fat) and phosphorus&mdash;such
as eggs, milk, whole wheat bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
fish, roe, etc.&mdash;much may be done to
arrest the progress of the disease.</p>

<p>This, in combination with the proper
kind of exercise&mdash;particularly those
forms of which the "Fraenkel Movement
System" is an example,&mdash;will do a wonderful
amount of good in re-educating
such groups of nerves in the spinal column
as have not yet suffered degenerative
changes.</p>

<p>The following diet is a mere suggestion,
subject to change in order to meet the
conditions of temperature, age, and
activity.</p>

<p>Immediately on rising, the patient
should take a few spoonfuls of strained
orange juice and drink a cup of hot water.
He should also devote a few minutes to
deep breathing, and such moderate exercises
as he is able to endure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">BREAKFAST</p>

<p>The whites of four eggs and the yolks of two
(If digestion is good, the whites of six eggs may
be taken&mdash;one yolk to each two whites)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>A glass of milk</p>

<p>A tablespoonful of nuts</p>

<p>One very ripe banana with cream</p>

<p>Three or four dates</p>

<p class="center">LUNCHEON</p>

<p>Three or four eggs whipped eight minutes;
to each egg add one teaspoonful of lemon juice,
and a heaping teaspoonful of sugar; whip this
mixture into a quart of milk; drink slowly</p>

<p class="center">DINNER</p>

<p>Smelts, or any small fish</p>

<p>A Spanish onion, baked in casserole dish</p>

<p>Corn bread</p>

<p>Buttermilk or skimmed milk</p>

<p>One fresh vegetable, cooked plain</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to this diet, there should
be a regular daily schedule of exercise
and deep breathing, which the patient
should be required to carry out with rigid
precision and regularity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of exercise
and massage</div>

<p>In nearly all cases of locomotor ataxia
the body is unable to cast off
the generated poisons, or
used-up tissue, the result being
that the new building material (food)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
taken in is not appropriated. This condition
of atrophy must be overcome by
exercise, massage, fomentation (wrapping
the patient in a hot, wet blanket), or by
anything that will induce excessive superficial
circulation.</p>

<p>If one afflicted with locomotor ataxia
can be induced to arise from his lethargy
and exert himself, following the methods
herein suggested, a gradual increase in
strength is very likely to be experienced
inside of two or three months, and sometimes
a complete arrest of the process
may be expected in time.</p>

<p>The writer had a patient, a retired ship
captain, who came under his treatment
after suffering for twelve years with
locomotor ataxia, and after twelve months
declared himself cured. The only evidence
remaining of his former condition
at this writing is shown when he attempts
to turn around suddenly, and his control
of the lumbar and motor muscles are
undergoing such improvement that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
this symptom, it seems, will finally
disappear.</p>

<h4>COLDS, CATARRH, HAY FEVER, ASTHMA,
INFLUENZA</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Overeating a
common cause of capillary
congestion</div>

<p>These disorders are grouped under a
general heading because there are a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
fundamental laws that affect them all alike.
Capillary congestion is a common cause in
all these disorders, and anything
that will produce this
condition will cause, or at
least augment catarrh, hay fever, asthma,
influenza, and colds. As overeating is the
primary cause of congestion throughout
the capillary system, it, rather than exposure,
is the most common cause of all
these disorders. The treatment that will
remove or prevent this form of congestion
will, therefore, remove a primary
cause, when such remedial measures may
be employed as each case demands.</p>


<h5>COLDS&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>That condition commonly known as a
cold is merely a congestion of effete matter
and toxic substances in the body-cells,
coming from two causes, and, so far
as my experience has been able to guide
me, from two causes only, namely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Overeating</p>

<p>2 Exposure to violent atmospheric
changes</p></blockquote>


<h5>COLDS&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms from both causes manifest
themselves in exactly the same way,
therefore it becomes very necessary to
ascertain what the sufferer has been
eating, both as to quantity and as to
kind of foods during the previous forty-eight
hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colds caused
by overeating</div>

<p>It often occurs that colds from overeating
are cumulative, that is, the patient
habitually takes too much
fat, sweets, or meat, especially
the two latter articles,
and these may have been digested, and
their nutritive elements may have passed
into the circulation, but the body being
unable to use them, they finally begin
to decompose and are converted into alcohol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
and other decomposition products.
An excess of this effete matter brought
to the lungs is called a "cold."</p>

<p>If one who is blessed with good digestion
and assimilation should habitually
take an amount of nutrition in excess of
his needs, it will manifest itself first,
perhaps, in the growth of adipose tissue,
and later in the various disorders called
autointoxication, among which are colds,
catarrh, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colds caused
by exposure</div>

<p>If the body be exposed to a violent
draft of cold air, and sufficient motion
is not exerted to keep the
circulation active, or if the
feet be exposed to cold and
wet, Nature, in obedience to the law of
self-defense, closes the pores of the skin
against the intrusion, hence the poisonous
and effete matter that is constantly
passing off through these openings cannot
escape, but it is picked up by the blood
and carried to the lungs to be oxidized or
burned in the process of breathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Colds from overeating
and exposure, identical</div>

<p>If the amount of poisons thus brought
to the lungs be in excess of the amount
that can be consumed or
burned, a form of congestion
will take place (in the lungs)
causing first irritation, then suppuration,
which must be thrown off in the form of
mucus. It matters not whether the congestion
is caused by exposure or overeating,
the effects are identically the
same, and Nature's method of ridding
the body of these poisons is the same in
either case. The only difference between
an ordinary cold and pneumonia is one
of degree.</p>


<h5>COLDS&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>Since colds are merely a form of congestion,
first in the capillary vessels and
next in the lungs, the first thing to be
done is to cease eating. The misunderstanding
of the old adage "stuff a cold
and starve a fever" has killed thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
of ignorant but innocent people. Its real
meaning is, if you stuff a cold, you will
have to starve an internal fever.</p>

<p>In the treatment of colds, I would suggest
the following method of procedure:</p>

<p class="noind">1 (a) Omit all food except&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="colds">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">{Such as&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">{Apples</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Juice of subacid fruits</td><td align="left">{Grapes</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">{Peaches</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">{Plums</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>This should be continued until
the congestion is relieved, whether
it be one day or a week. (For list
of subacid fruits, see Lesson VIII,
p. 313.)</p>

<p>(b) Drink copiously of pure, cool
water</p>

<p class="noind">2 Select a light diet of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Nuts<br />
Salads<br />
White of eggs<br />
Fresh watery vegetables<br />
Limited quantity of carbohydrates<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>If the cold is severe, a Turkish bath
or any treatment that will produce liberal
perspiration, will aid in the elimination of
body-poisons and the relief of congestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedial value of
fresh air and exercise</div>

<p>Inasmuch as the blood is conveying
an excessive amount of poisons to the
lungs for oxidation, much
depends upon the amount
of pure air that is breathed
and the cell capacity of the lungs for
oxidation; therefore the sufferer, if unable
to be out of doors, should be warmly
clad and placed before an open window,
or on a veranda in the sunshine, if possible,
where every breath will be of fresh
air. If, however, the patient is able to
go out, every moment possible should be
spent walking briskly in the open air.
Every morning the patient should be
given a vigorous "sponge" with a towel
dipped in cold water, and rubbed down
with a dry one. This should be done in a
warm room, with the body well protected
from undue exposure. The room should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
be thoroughly ventilated at night, and
in severe cases all garments and sheets
used during the day should be thoroughly
aired or changed at night.</p>

<p>The old methods of drugging and of
excluding the air and sunshine, which is in
reality poisoning the patient both within
and without, is little less than criminal.</p>

<p>A cool shower, or a sponge bath, together
with a vigorous rub every morning
immediately on rising, and a normal quantity
of natural food, render the body almost
entirely immune from colds, la grippe, and
all forms of capillary congestion and
effete and toxic (poisonous) substances.</p>

<h5>CATARRH&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Decomposition
of unused food the primary
cause of catarrh</div>

<p>The causes of catarrh are attributed
by all old school writers to acute coryza
and exposure to irritating
dust, or cold, moist, and
perhaps infectious air. These
may be secondary causes and may augment
catarrh after it has appeared, but
experience has proved that the primary
cause of catarrh is the decomposition of
unused food material, and that Nature
throws off the decomposition products resulting
therefrom, through the nasal
passage, in the form of mucus. In the
support of this theory I may refer to
many cases of ordinary stomach trouble,
constipation, torpidity of the liver, etc.,
that have had my personal care. In
nearly all these cases I found that, when
the diet was balanced according to the
age and the occupation of the patient,
with the climate or time of the year,
practically all catarrhal symptoms disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
and exposure to atmospheric
changes, dust, and the usual things that
had formerly brought on catarrhal conditions,
did not affect the patient.</p>


<h5>CATARRH&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of catarrh are constant
secretion of nasal mucus, which often
passes off into the postnasal and nasopharyngeal
spaces. This mucus is usually
thin and of a light-colored watery
character, varying in quantity according
to exposure or activity, the quantity of
food eaten, and the temperature of the
atmosphere.</p>


<h5>CATARRH&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>In the treatment of catarrh, avoid the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
All meats<br />
Heavy starchy foods (Especially white flour products)<br />
Sweets (See Lesson VIII, p. 334)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>

<p>The diet should consist of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
A reasonable quantity of proteid foods in the form of&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beans&nbsp; &nbsp;  Peas</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eggs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sour milk</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nuts</span><br />
Bananas<br />
Coarse cereals&mdash;twice a day; such as entire wheat and rye<br />
Fish (small quantity, occasionally)<br />
Fresh vegetables<br />
Green watery salads<br />
Non-acid fruits<br />
Wheat bran&mdash;<br />
(Enough to keep the bowels in normal condition)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Nasal breathing</div>

<p>Deep breathing through the nostrils
and vigorous exercise should be taken
freely, especially just after
rising and just before retiring.
Special attention should
be given to breathing through the nose.
When the air is pure, there is nothing
more healing and remedial in the treatment
of catarrh than the abundant
passage of air through the nasal cavities.</p>

<h4>HAY FEVER</h4>

<p>Hay fever might be called autumnal
catarrh. It is popularly supposed to be
irritation of the nasal passages and
the bronchial tubes, caused by the flying
pollen from various flowers and plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>


<h5>HAY FEVER&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of hay fever are usually
a salty discharge from the eyes and the
nostrils, followed by severe irritation of
the mucous lining of the nasal cavity, a
sense of fullness in the head, and violent
sneezing.</p>


<h5>HAY FEVER&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>It has not been the writer's opportunity
to examine deeply into the actual
causes of hay fever, but it has been his
good fortune to cure many cases.</p>

<p>The remedy should be confined to&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Fresh air and sunshine<br />
Close observation of the rules of diet<br />
Total abstinence from all forms of stimulants and narcotics<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>I would suggest the following diet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Berries<br />
Eggs<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>Fish (Limited quantity)<br />
Green and fresh vegetables<br />
Sour milk (Buttermilk)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Where this kind of milk cannot be obtained, the ordinary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">sweet milk will suffice)</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The diet must be governed, as already
explained in many other cases, by the
individual requirements of the patient
in regard to the amount of exercise, the
temperature of the atmosphere, and the
age of the patient. In spring and summer
is the ideal time to remove the causes of
hay fever and effect its cure. (See
Catarrh.)</p>

<h4>ASTHMA</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The cause of asthma is congestion in,
or constriction of, the bronchial tubes.
This congestion is usually caused by
overeating and the excessive use of narcotics
and stimulants such as tobacco,
liquors, and beer. The excessive use of
sugar and starches, or what is generally
known as carbohydrates, will set up a
form of difficult breathing, or at least
augment asthmatic tendencies. This condition
is more likely to occur among those
whose lungs are weakened and who have
a tendency toward consumption.</p>


<h5>ASTHMA&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>There are but few conditions preceding
asthma that can properly be called symptoms.
The attacks are usually violent
and frequently come on late at night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
The patient suffers with a sense of asphyxia,
which causes the impression of
death from suffocation.</p>


<h5>ASTHMA&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The causes of asthma can be removed
by diet, fresh air and exercise. If the
patient can take a reasonable amount
of exercise, sunshine and fresh air, the
cure will be more rapid, but if this cannot
be done, the diet can be limited so that
there will be but little waste, therefore
little congestion, and the necessity for
exercise and fresh air will be reduced to
the minimum.</p>

<p>In cases of asthma, the diet should be
confined to&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="noind">
Egg albumin<br />
Limited quantity of nuts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(No more than two ounces per day)<br />
An abundance of&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh and green vegetables<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salads<br />
</p>

<p>If meat be taken at all, it should be confined
to fish, young and tender game, or fowl, although
these articles are not recommended.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>If the patient be obese or above normal
weight, the diet given for obesity should
be rigidly observed. If of normal weight,
the body should be fed somewhat below
its physical requirements, even if a radical
loss in weight should be experienced
for the first three or four weeks.</p>

<p>If the patient is emaciated, then the
diet should consist of six or eight eggs,
and about one quart of milk daily,
together with sweet fruits and fresh vegetables.
Milk may be given in larger
quantities, up to three quarts daily, if
all other food except eggs be omitted.</p>

<h4>INFLUENZA</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Bacteria the
result, not the cause</div>

<p>This disorder is popularly supposed
to be of bacteriological origin, but upon
this question the scientific
world is much divided. In
the opinion of the writer the
cause of influenza cannot be traced to
bacteria or any other form of germ life.
Bacteria is nearly always present in decomposing
animal matter. It is the
opinion of the writer, therefore, that
bacteria is the result and not the cause
of influenza. It might be described as
an acute activity of the entire system in
throwing off accumulated waste or toxic
substances. This process of excretion
will become more difficult at certain
times, during violent changes in temperature,
and many people in small
communities may be similarly afflicted,
which no doubt gives rise to the theory
that it is a disease of germ origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>


<h5>INFLUENZA&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms are headache, languor,
sometimes nausea and congestion in the
lungs, together with acute irritation of
the nasal passages.</p>


<h5>INFLUENZA&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The logical remedy is normal temperature
of environment, abundance of fresh
air, and omission of all solid food.</p>

<p>There are two specific forms of diet
to be recommended&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
1 A liquid diet entirely, such as&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Juice of berries</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Orange juice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Milk</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Very thin vegetable soups</span><br />
<br />
2 Confine diet entirely to&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nuts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fruits</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fresh green vegetables</span><br />
<br />
3 Eliminate fats, starches, sugars<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Either of the above suggestions will be
sufficient to control an ordinary case of
influenza if it is rigidly adhered to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>In the spring and summer, the latter
diet would be recommended, while in
winter, when green and fresh vegetables,
fruits, etc., cannot be procured, the milk
diet should be given.</p>

<p>In cases of influenza, see menus for
colds, hay fever, and catarrh. Take
choice, giving preference to those prescribed
for hay fever. Whichever menu
is chosen, it should be taken in its entirety;
that is, do not select the meals
from two or three menus.</p>


<h4>INSOMNIA</h4>

<h5>THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The inability to sleep is caused:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">1 By intestinal congestion or sluggish
intestinal peristalsis</p>

<p class="hanging">2 By irritation of the mucous
membrane of the stomach
and intestines</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">3 By the presence of gas, superacidity,
and the consequent
irritation and excitation of the
nerves leading out from the
digestive tract</p>

<p class="hanging">4 By the use of tobacco</p>

<p class="hanging">5 By the consumption of stimulants
and narcotics, which are
so universal and so life-destroying</p></blockquote>

<p>The effects of (4) and (5) upon the
stomach are much the same as those of
overeating, in that they invariably cause
supersecretion of acid, and, in the majority
of instances, produce false appetite,
thus augmenting the baneful habit of
overeating.</p>


<h5>INSOMNIA&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The logical remedy for insomnia is
first to eliminate the use of tea, coffee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
tobacco, distilled and malted liquors,
and drugs of every kind whatsoever, as
the ultimate effect upon the stomach of
all these things is the same. When this
has been done, the amount of food required
by the body, governed by the three
laws of age, work, and temperature of
environment, should be accurately laid
out so that the quantity of food may
be controlled and overeating avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cases necessitating
a special remedial diet</div>

<p>The diet should also be balanced according
to the chemical needs of the body
heretofore mentioned. In a
a majority of cases, when the
food scientist can prevail
upon his patient to confine himself to a
normal quantity of food, reasonably well
balanced as to nutrient elements, the
stomach will perform its natural functions,
and fermentation with its long train of
ills will gradually disappear. This can,
in many instances, be accomplished by
merely standing out of Nature's way,
but in some cases the stomach, liver, intestines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
and nervous system have been
so long abused and so impaired that they
seem to have entered into a conspiracy
for mutual protection, hence may not
yield to the "normal quantity" or "balanced
dietary" remedy. In these cases
a remedial diet must be followed, such
as will restore the balance by omitting
altogether the elements on which the
patient had been overfed, and taking an
excessive quantity of the elements for
the lack of which the patient had been
suffering.</p>

<p>Drink plain water.</p>


<h4>RHEUMATISM&mdash;GOUT</h4>

<p>These disorders are grouped under the
same heading because they are of identical
origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why rheumatism
manifests itself largely
in the joints</div>

<p>In the average body of five feet eight
inches in height, there are about 2,000
miles of tubing, classified
under the various names of
arteries, veins, capillaries,
and nerves. Altogether this is called the
circulatory system. A vast amount of
this system is infinitely small. Every
atom of food taken into the circulation
that is not used or converted into energy
passes into some of these infinitely small
tubes and nerve fibers. These tubes are
susceptible of considerable expansion in
the fleshy part of the body, but where
they pass through the joints or cartilage,
there is but little expansion. There these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
undissolved atoms are most likely to congest,
therefore the first expression of
rheumatism is usually in the joints. If
it takes place at the terminals (fingers or
toes), it is called gout; if in the muscles,
it is called muscular or inflammatory
rheumatism. This congestion accounts
for the stiffness and lack of elasticity in
the joints. These accumulated atoms
become in time almost as hard as bone.</p>


<h5>RHEUMATISM&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The cause of both rheumatism and gout
are practically the same&mdash;that is, overeating,
especially of flesh and starchy
foods. <em>Meat</em> and <em>bread</em> are the two
things that cause nearly all rheumatism,
though rheumatic symptoms often appear
among vegetarians, caused by the
overconsumption of starchy food, especially
when acid fruits are used. The ideal
diet for producing rheumatism is cereals,
white bread, meat, acid fruit and eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>


<h5>RHEUMATISM&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of rheumatism often
manifest themselves a year or more
before an attack comes on.</p>

<p>The <em>earlier</em> symptoms are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Languor, stupidity and dulness<br />
in the morning<br />
<br />
Impaired circulation and a<br />
sense of body-heaviness<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>later</em> symptoms are pain in the
joints or muscles, often followed by inflammation
and severe soreness and stiffness.</p>

<p>The rheumatic usually has good digestion.
In fact, it is the ability of the
digestive organs to force more nutrition
into the circulation than is needed, that
produces this dis-ease.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases of rheumatism and
gout the patient will be found to have
been a large consumer of starchy food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
especially of the cereal family, which is the
most difficult of all starches to dissolve.</p>


<h5>GOUT&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">An excess of
starch causes an excess of
acid</div>

<p>The primary cause of gout is faulty
metabolism; behind this, however, are
other causes. The metabolic
process is rendered faulty
or incomplete by the overingestion
of heavy starchy foods. This
excess of starch, which the body is not
able to appropriate or use, becomes
acted upon by the excess of acid
which is always present when too much
starch is consumed. This harmful
process is often augmented by the eating
of fruit-acids such as grapefruit, lemons,
oranges, pineapples, and other citrus-fruits.
In addition to these causes the
uric acid residual in meat and in the
yolk of eggs is an important factor in the
causation of gouty or rheumatic conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>


<h5>GOUT&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The earlier symptoms of gout are nervousness,
irritability, and sometimes insomnia.
In the second stages, shooting
pains through the fingers and toes are
experienced, and later a swelling or a
slight inflammation of these terminals.
After this acute condition has existed for
perhaps a year, the pain may cease and
the joints may begin to swell. Knots are
also often formed, especially upon the
hands, and sometimes upon the feet.</p>


<h5>RHEUMATISM, GOUT&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The remedy for these disorders may
be said to lie wholly within the realm of
diet, exercise and oxidation, supplemented
by a liberal superficial application of
heat, such as Turkish and electric light
baths.</p>

<p>In all cases of rheumatism and gout,
the following should be omitted:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
All acid fruits, such as,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grapefruit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lemons</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Limes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oranges</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pineapples</span><br />
Eggs<br />
Red meats<br />
Starchy foods (Carbohydrate class)<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The diet should be confined to&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Fish and white meat of fowl<br />
Fresh vegetables<br />
Nuts<br />
Salads<br />
Sweet and non-acid fruits<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(See Lesson VIII, p. 313)</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">How to prevent
the active principle
of rheumatism</div>

<p>If the diet were confined wholly to
green salads, fresh vegetables and white
meats, it would remove the
causes of these disorders, and
inasmuch as Nature is always
striving to create perfect health, the
cause being removed, she would begin at
once to apply the remedy, by removing
the congested mass of undissolved calcareous
matter, atom by atom. Thus
the active principle of rheumatism would
disappear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the joints have become enlarged,
the best that can be done is to render
them flexible. It is almost impossible
to take out of them all the accumulated
deposits, and to reduce them to their
natural or normal size.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Natural perspiration
vs. artificial in the
treatment of rheumatism</div>

<p>In addition to the above-named restrictive
diet, the patient should be
given sufficient exercise each
day to generate enough heat
to cause perspiration. It
is well to remember that one
drop of perspiration forced out of the
body by activity is worth a dozen drawn
out of the body by the application of
superficial heat, such as the Turkish
bath. Natural perspiration should come
from exercise (muscular friction). This
is the method designed by Nature to
throw poisonous substances to the surface
in the form of sweat, thereby demolishing
the old cell and making a place for
the new. The Turkish bath and massage
is the lazy man's method of cheating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
Nature, and cannot possibly bring as good
results as can obedience to the natural
law of motion.</p>

<h4>BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE</h4>

<p>This disorder is confined entirely to
the kidneys. In its final analysis it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
nothing more than consumption or destruction
of the kidneys by thrusting
upon them a greater amount of waste
matter than they are capable of throwing
off, the result being (1) irritation; (2)
ulceration; (3) suppuration or consumption.</p>


<h5>BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The causes of Bright's dis-ease are
overingestion of food, especially sweets,
starches and meats; the taking of stimulants
and narcotics, and the consequent
failure of the body to eliminate the poisons
or waste accumulating therefrom.</p>


<h5>BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of Bright's dis-ease are
scant amount of urine, heavily laden
with solids and fatty granules, while
leucocytes and even red blood-corpuscles
are often shown, especially in advanced
cases. Dull pains in the small of the back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
and a general weakening in the lumbar
regions are common symptoms.</p>


<h5>BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Prevention of
Bright's dis-ease by correct
feeding</div>

<p>It has been popularly supposed, and
announced from many alleged sources of
authority, that there is no
remedy for this dis-ease, and
from the standpoint of Materia
Medica this probably is correct,
but from the standpoint of the natural
scientist there is a remedy. However,
Bright's dis-ease, like all others herein
discussed, can better be prevented than
cured, and under a correct dietetic regimen,
with plenty of exercise and fresh
air, the kidneys, like every other organ
of the body, will perform their normal
functions.</p>

<p>When Bright's dis-ease has made its
appearance, the first thing to be ascertained
is the character of the diet and
the general habits of eating and drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
during the previous two or three years;
secondly, the occupation or habits of
exercise, especially exposure to fresh air
and sunshine.</p>


<h5>BRIGHT'S DIS-EASE&mdash;THE TREATMENT</h5>

<p>A very restricted diet should be observed,
consisting largely of the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Fresh vegetables<br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>All <em>sweets</em> taken should be in the form
of sweet fruits. (See Lesson VIII, p. 313).</p>

<p>Milk is very beneficial in this condition&mdash;especially
when taken in the form
of buttermilk, clabbered milk, koumyss
or zoolak. The lactic acid ferments in
the sour milk help to destroy the germs
of putrefaction in the intestines, which
are always one of the aggravating causes
of Bright's disease.</p>

<p>Sometimes an exclusive acid milk diet
for a while works wonders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestions
for diet in different
seasons</div>

<p>If the patient is under treatment
in the spring and summer, as many
green plants and fresh sweet
fruits as possible should be
taken, in connection with the
milk, eliminating cereal starch entirely.
In the fall and winter, the many varieties
of apples and autumn vegetables may be
taken in liberal quantities.</p>


<h5>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR BRIGHT'S
DIS-EASE</h5>

<p>In the majority of cases it is well to
first put the patient on a short fast of
about twenty-four hours, and then begin
the diet with articles containing a liberal
quantity of cellulose, such as the entire
wheat, boiled; celery, cooked in casserole
dish.</p>

<p>Keep the bowels open by the use of
wheat bran, or grapes, if they are in
season, swallowing skins, seeds and pulp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>As in all sympathetic disorders, an
abundance of pure, cool water should be
taken and as much time as possible
should be spent in the open air and sunshine.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to limit the diet
to the minimum so that the excretory
organs can easily eliminate all waste
matter, and so that there may be no further
poisonous accumulations.</p>

<p>The diet should be somewhat restricted.</p>

<h4>DIABETES</h4>

<p>This disorder may be described as one
of malassimilation from the stomach,
liver, kidneys, and intestines, but to
the trained student it is better described
as a condition in which the capacity of
the body to burn or use grape-sugar has
become chronically depressed. It is usually
supplemented by a lack of physical
exercise and elimination of body-poisons.</p>


<h5>DIABETES&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>From the above explanation it will be
seen that diabetes, like all other dis-eases
of the digestive organs, is caused directly
by errors in eating&mdash;overconsumption of
carbohydrates (sweets and starches), and
albuminoids. These errors are augmented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
by inactivity, causing lack of assimilation
or utilization of nutritive elements.</p>


<h5>DIABETES&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h5>

<p>The symptoms of diabetes are intense
thirst and appetite, copious passing of
urine and the presence of excessive quantities
of sugar and uric acid therein.</p>


<h5>DIABETES&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<p>The selecting, proportioning and balancing
of the daily menu, together with
an observance of the natural laws hitherto
laid out, will prevent diabetes, but
after it has made its appearance the
remedy lies in simple and limited feeding.</p>

<p>The sufferer should be put upon a rigid
diet of fresh vegetables, nuts, fruits, and
salads. If the body has not been trained
to accept these foods, the diet might consist
of the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noind">
Bloodless (white) meats<br />
Eggs<br />
Fats&mdash;reasonable quantity (Olive-oil, butter, cream)<br />
Fish<br />
Fresh vegetables<br />
Green salads&mdash;generous quantity<br />
Nuts<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>If the patient be <em>overweight</em>, the diet
should consist largely of subacid fruits
and nuts. If <em>underweight</em>, a liberal
quantity of sour milk should be given,
especially whole soured milk in which the
cream is also present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet in extreme
cases of diabetes</div>

<p>In extreme cases the patient should
be required to subsist upon Pignolia
(the pine) nuts, and green or
fresh vegetables uncooked.
The writer knows of a gentleman
suffering from a very advanced
case of diabetes, who, in utter despair,
adopted a diet consisting entirely of
pine nuts, merely because they appealed
to his taste, while nothing else did. A
noticeable change for the better was seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
in a week, especially in regard to the
amount of sugar passed in the urine. He
adhered rigidly to this diet for nearly
three months. He then added green salads
and carrots, and the seventh and
eighth months a few fresh cooked vegetables,
and was pronounced thoroughly
cured before the year had expired. This
might have been due partly to the limited
bill of fare, but undoubtedly it was largely
due to the food elements contained in this
wonderful product of the Italian pine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span></p>

<p>Drink an abundance of pure water.</p>

<p>In treating diabetes, foods containing
starch and sugar should not be wholly
eliminated from the diet, but should be
administered in limited proportions, or
such quantities as the body could use.
Starches and sugars contained in cereals
and legumes, however, should in extreme
cases be omitted because they are difficult
to digest and to assimilate. If the
digestion is impaired, the body is likely
to cast out these valuable nutrients
through the kidneys, rather than labor to
digest and to assimilate them. The
starches and sugars found in fresh vegetables
(See table, Vol. III, p. 614), are
easily digested and assimilated, therefore
in cases of diabetes the body will use or
appropriate them, as this entails less
energy than that required to cast them
out.</p>


<h4>CONSUMPTION</h4>

<p>For many centuries chemists, scientists,
and medical men generally have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
vainly battling with this dis-ease. It is
only within the past decade that it has
been understood or successfully treated.</p>

<p>Consumption is an infection of the
lungs by the bacteria called bacillus
tuberculosis. The local inflammation
produces lesions, and the formation of
small growths (nodules) of gray, white, or
yellowish tubercles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authorities
differ concerning the bacillus</div>

<p>It is yet an open question and a matter
of grave doubt in the minds of various
authorities on this subject
as to whether the bacilli is
the real <em>cause</em>, or the <em>result</em>
of the dis-ease. The fact that a person
or an animal afflicted with tuberculosis
was in "susceptible condition" is much
emphasized by all authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Predisposing
conditions and occupations</div>

<p>Such disorders as catarrh, influenza,
chronic colds, etc., are all predisposing
conditions. Such trades as
metal grinding, spinning,
weaving, cleaning grain,
street sweeping, or any vocation necessitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
the breathing of large quantities
of dust, are termed predisposing occupations,
which show very clearly that all
writers are practically agreed that the
real cause is undoubtedly due to imperfect
oxidation or impaired use of the lungs.</p>

<p>The above conditions may be brought
on from two specific causes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 By the habitual overingestion
of food, and the consequent congestion
of effete matter in the
lungs, brought thither by the circulation
in its effort to dispose of
the waste-products by burning
them with oxygen.</p>

<p>2 Through the agency of foreign
substances breathed in, which
gradually congest, and prevent
thorough oxidation and normal
activity of the excretory function
of the lungs.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Bacilli the result,
not the cause of consumption</div>

<p>The opinion of the writer is that the
bacillus above referred to is the result
and not the cause of this dis-ease, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
that such living organisms (bacilli) are
created in the economy of
Nature to dispose of this
congested matter, just as
she, in her provident economy, disposes
of the carcass of a dead animal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Facts shown by
experiments and by modern
treatment of consumption</div>

<p>The fact that a tuberculosis culture,
deposited in the lungs of another animal,
reproduces the dis-ease,
proves nothing, as it may
have been planted in susceptible
soil, well prepared for
the growth and the development of the
bacteria. The fact that some very
healthy animals did not contract the
dis-ease by this method, supports the
theory that if conditions are not favorable
the culture is killed by the process
of oxidation. This sustains the theory
that the bacillus tuberculosis is the result,
and not the cause of this dread dis-ease.
This theory is further supported by the
results of the most modern and only
successful methods of treating it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span></p>


<h5>CONSUMPTION&mdash;THE TREATMENT</h5>

<p>When beginning treatment, the tubercular
patient should be restricted as to
diet for the purpose of giving Nature an
opportunity to make use of every atom
of food taken into the body, leaving
nothing to go to waste.</p>

<p>The diet should consist almost wholly
of vegetable fats, sour milk, nuts, fruits,
salads, and eggs, with a limited amount
of readily digestible carbohydrates.</p>

<p>The following menu is given as a fair
example of selection as to quantity and
combinations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">BREAKFAST</p>

<p>Cantaloup, orange, grapes, pears, or persimmons</p>

<p>Two or three eggs, whipped five minutes,
adding a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and one of
sugar to each egg</p>

<p class="center">
LUNCHEON</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>A green salad eaten with nuts, a dash of lemon juice and olive-oil</p>

<p>One or two fresh vegetables, including a baked potato</p>

<p>One egg prepared as for breakfast</p>

<p>A glass of sour milk</p>

<p class="center">
DINNER</p>

<p>A green salad, with nuts and oil</p>

<p>Eggs or buttermilk</p>

<p>One or two fresh vegetables</p>

<p>A baked potato</p>

<p>The above menus may be increased
in quantity after the first
week or ten days, at least sufficient
to meet all physical requirements,
and the articles may be changed
according to seasons.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Dietetic suggestions
for spring and summer in
consumptive cases</div>

<p>In spring and summer all kinds of
fruits and berries may be used, and such
vegetables as squash, asparagus,
spinach, beets, green
peas and beans, turnips,
parsnips, carrots, and green
corn. All of these vegetables should be
cooked in a casserole dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>The bowels should be kept free. (See
treatment for "Constipation," p. 437.)
Drink copiously of pure water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestions for
the treatment of mild cases
of consumption</div>

<p>If the patient is not far advanced, he
should seek employment which affords
constant exercise in the open
air, preferably in the hills
or mountains, and the labor
should be of such a character as to cause
normal activity of the liver and the
bowels, and to enforce deep respiration.
A spirometer or lung-measuring machine
should be secured, and the patient should
practise upon this night and morning,
endeavoring each day to register from one
to five cubic inches more than the previous
day, until every air cell of the lungs
is opened and the full capacity is reached,
which should be about 315 cubic inches
for the average man, and 250 for the
woman of normal size.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General rules
of hygiene in consumptive
cases</div>

<p>Contrary to usual customs and theories,
the patient should take a cool sponge
bath every morning, in a warm room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
except in very cold weather. It should be
followed by a vigorous rub down and deep
breathing. Wear thin cotton
under-clothes. Dress
as lightly as possible,
except when exposed where exercise or
motion cannot be taken, such as riding
in an open car or vehicle. Nature's
method of producing hardihood and increasing
endurance is by means of exposure.
The house-plant life is conducive
and favorable to tuberculosis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of
perfect oxidation</div>

<p>The most important thing in the treatment
of this dis-ease is perfect oxidation
(breathing). Every cell of
the lungs should be filled at
every breath. The lungs
should be filled to their extreme capacity,
one hundred or more times a day, with
pure, fresh, dustless air. The patient
should never breathe the same breath
twice; especially should he not breathe
the air that has been used by other people,
or by pet animals in a closed room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to carry out this regimen, it
is necessary to live out of doors day and
night, winter and summer.</p>

<p>The tubercular patient should sleep in
a tent, or upon an open piazza every
night, regardless of the weather or the
temperature of the atmosphere. If these
rules were observed the white plague
would lose some of its terrors.</p>

<h4>HEART TROUBLE</h4>

<div class="sidenote">The heart, a
sentinel of the body</div>

<p>The heart may well be called the thermometer
of the body. Under normal
conditions it is never heard
from, but under abnormal
conditions it is the first and
the most reliable sentinel of the body.
It stands eternally on duty and sends its
danger signals to the brain with truthful
accuracy, whether the trouble be of
physical, mental, or emotional origin. A
word or a sound sent through the air enters
the ear and is analyzed by the brain,
but the heart registers accurately its
effect upon the physical body. We see a
face or an occurrence a block away,
and through the optic nerves it is comprehended
by the brain, but the heart
alone registers or gives back to the brain
the effect upon the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity for
heeding the symptoms of
the heart</div>

<p>This little engine, but little bigger than
one's fist, pumps about twenty tons of
blood every day above its own level in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
every body of average size, besides sending
the life fluids of the blood-serum with
lightning speed to the parts
of the remotest anatomy,
carting away the effete
and poisonous matter to the lungs to be
burned with oxygen, and carrying new
building material from cell to cell for
repairs. Should we not, therefore, take
good care of, and heed the warnings of
so wonderful a piece of automatic mechanism?
Should we not study all its symptoms
told in a language sympathetic and
truthful, and as unerring as the laws that
govern the movement of worlds in space?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some undefined
technical terms</div>

<p>The heart gives off various symptoms
indicating the different kinds of sins we
commit against the natural
laws of our organisms. Medical
men have named some
of these symptoms as follows: Dilation,
hypertrophy, atrophy, aneurism, inflammation,
valvular derangement, etc., but
in none of their reference works are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
causes of these so-called dis-eases clearly
defined. Fatty degeneration is the only
one that is explained, the term meaning
that the heart has been deprived of room
in which to do its work, owing to surrounding
fatty accumulations.</p>


<h5>HEART TROUBLE&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<p>The blood enters the heart through the
superior venae cavae flowing to the right
lobe or auricle, then it is pumped by the
heart beats to the right ventricle. From
here it is forced through the pulmonary
artery to the lungs where it is purified
and charged with the oxygen we breathe.
From the lungs the blood returns through
the pulmonary veins to the left auricle
of the heart, and then to the left ventricle.
Having passed once through the
purifying plant and twice through the
distributing station, it is now sent out
through the large systematic artery and
distributed to every capillary cell of the
body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heart trouble
caused by (carbon
dioxid) gas</div>

<p>From the accumulation of gas caused
by fermenting food the transverse colon
becomes very much distended.
This interferes with
the free flow of blood
into and out of the heart, causing
at times a very faint heart action
from a lack of inflow, and again a very
heavy, rapid action when the blood spurts
through. This produces dizziness and
vertigo, and sometimes where the inflow
is greater than the heart can discharge,
there is arterial overflow; the heart
ceases action, and the victim falls prostrate,
and sometimes dies.</p>

<p>(See "Fermentation&mdash;The Symptoms,"
p. 426.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heart trouble
caused by calcareous
substances</div>

<p>Many cases of serious heart trouble
are caused by habitual overeating, especially
of grain and grain
products. The calcareous
substances from these products
are deposited in the capillary vessels
and in the joints, causing rheumatism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, lumbago,
gout, and other evidences of our lack of
knowledge. When the one thus afflicted
follows a sedentary occupation, taking
but little fresh air and exercise, a hardening
or stiffening of the arteries is usually
the result.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that if one would eat
moderately, omit stimulants and narcotics,
take but a limited quantity of starchy
foods, a liberal amount of fresh air,
deep breathing and exercise, heart trouble
would be unknown.</p>


<h5>HEART TROUBLE&mdash;THE REMEDY</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Diet for heart
trouble</div>

<p>For the treatment of those who are
afflicted with heart trouble I would suggest
a very limited diet of
nuts, fruits, salads, fresh
tuber and green vegetables,
eggs, and a limited quantity of coarse
foods, such as boiled whole wheat, wheat
bran, grapes (seeds and all), and all coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
vegetables, with an abundance of mild
exercise and fresh air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercise for
heart trouble</div>

<p>In cases of heart trouble no greater
mistake can be made than to cease
exercise, as is often prescribed
by well-meaning doctors.
This is compromising
with the enemy, with absolute certainty
of ultimate defeat. Exercise, above all,
is the very thing that is most needed.</p>

<p>The patient should begin moderately
at first, daily increasing the time and the
tensity of the work until a balance is
established between the intake and the
outflow of blood to the heart.</p>

<p>For foods to be eaten and omitted in
cases of heart trouble, see p. 573. Also
see menus for Fermentation.</p>


<h4>DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN</h4>

<p>There are two distinct kinds of skin
dis-eases, namely&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 Local</p>

<p>2 Constitutional</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>local</em> is that which manifests itself
in the form of pimples or eruptions which
come and go, and are of only a few days'
duration. The second, or <em>constitutional</em>
kind, is that which manifests itself by a
permanent irritation or inflammation,
which is classified as eczema, psoriasis,
etc.</p>


<h5>DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN&mdash;THE CAUSE</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Local disorders</div>

<p>The local or temporary disorders are
caused and controlled entirely by diet,
usually overeating. Sometimes
overingestion of some
one particular food; for instance, too
much acid taken in the form of berries,
or citrus-fruits, will often produce an
eruption or a rash within a few hours
after eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Eruptions augmented
by autointoxication</div>

<p>That form of pimples or eruptions
caused by overeating is usually augmented
by constipation or by some
form of intestinal congestion,
which has been given the
impressive title of autointoxication.
Autointoxication is a broad
word that seems to have been invented,
not for the purpose of explaining, but
for the purpose of evading the necessity
of explaining. The meaning of this word
(self-poisoning) has been narrowed down
by the profession to describe the above
conditions, but in reality it should be
applied to all forms of self-poisoning by
overeating; eating the wrong combinations
of food; the use of all stimulants
and narcotics, such as tobacco, tea, coffee,
liquor and wines of all kinds. In fact,
self-poisoning from the last-named sources
is as common as from errors in eating,
and much more difficult to control.</p>

<p>Nearly all dis-eases are traceable directly
to unexcreted poisons which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
body has been unable to throw off.
These poisons are from two sources:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1 The natural poisons or gases
that accumulate in the body under
normal conditions, which, if prevented
in any manner from passing
off, will cause some kind of disorder
which would come under the
head of autointoxication.</p>

<p>2 The poisons that accumulate
under abnormal conditions, such
as hitherto described, and which
are very often made manifest by
eruptions of the skin.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Constitutional
disorders</div>

<p>That form of skin dis-ease known as
eczema has baffled the medical world for
many centuries. It has hitherto
been treated locally by
the most skilled and learned
specialists, in the belief that it was of
bacteriological origin, but modern experiments
in the field of food chemistry have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
demonstrated the fact that it can be cured
by scientific feeding, therefore it is only
fair to assume that its origin or primary
cause is due to some form of self-poisoning,
caused by errors in eating and faulty
metabolism.</p>


<h5>DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN&mdash;THE TREATMENT</h5>

<p>If a rash should appear on the skin
after eating acid fruit or berries, one would
naturally know the remedy; namely,
omit acids, limit the quantity of food
at the next meal, drink copiously of pure
water and breathe an abundance of
fresh air. The same general remedy
should be observed in all cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preliminary
treatment for dis-eases of
the skin</div>

<p>The pimples or eruptions will gradually
disappear when the causes are removed,
and the same rule
will apply to eczema or any
chronic form of skin irritation.
The patient should first be put
upon a short fast of two or three days'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
duration, and caused to perspire freely
each day for an hour or so. This can be
accomplished by the aid of the Turkish
bath, but preferably by exercise. On the
first day the fast should be broken by
taking either the juice of such fruits as
plums, peaches, apples, grapes, and pears,
or the juice of cantaloup and watermelon.</p>


<h5>DIET FOR DIS-EASES OF THE SKIN</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>The diet should be gradually broadened by the
addition of green salads, uncooked carrots, onions
and turnips, and a limited quantity of such
cooked vegetables as spinach, asparagus, squash,
fresh corn, green peas or beans when in season.
Later, the diet should be confined mainly to egg
whites, skimmed milk, nuts, sweet fruits, salads,
fresh green vegetables, including a very limited
quantity of sugar and coarse cereals, two or
three times a week.</p></blockquote>


<h5>DIET FOR CHRONIC ECZEMA</h5>

<blockquote>

<p>In extreme and chronic cases of eczema the diet
should be confined entirely to green salads,
sweet fruits, fresh vegetables, and about two
ounces of olive-oil daily, feeding the body always
somewhat below its normal requirements as
indicated by hunger.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>Under this diet and regimen the patient
will, of course, lose weight and possibly
strength, but the body will so completely
make use of all nutrition and the elimination
of all waste will be made so completely,
through the excretory channels,
that the dis-ease will gradually disappear,
owing to the removal of its primary causes.</p>

<p>For "Sweet Fruits," see Lesson VIII,
p. 313.</p>


<h4>APPENDICITIS</h4>

<p>There are three large colons in the intestinal
tract which form an inverted
U, the "ascending," "transverse," and
"descending" colons. The descending
colon is situated on the left side, its lower
part opening into the rectal cavity. The
ascending colon, located on the right side,
connects with the small intestines, while
the transverse colon goes across at a
point opposite the navel, connecting the
two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The vermiform
appendix a useful organ</div>

<p>To the lower part of the ascending
colon is attached the vermiform appendix. Authorities are much
divided as to the function of
this organ. Many claim that
it is a relic of anthropoid man, while
others contend that it is a useful and
important part of the anatomy. In the
opinion of the writer it secretes a valuable
digestive fluid and therefore performs
a function valuable both to digestion and
to alimentation. In the ascending colon
is the only place in the thirty-six feet of
intestinal tubing where the fecal matter
must rise against the law of gravity,
therefore, if there is any congestion
throughout this canal, it is most likely to
occur in this colon. While the bowels
may seem to act normally, yet, owing to
the tremendous amount of waste matter
necessary to be conveyed from the body,
and the peristaltic action involved in
moving it along, especially at this point,
some of the fecal matter often lodges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
under the small folds and in the flexuous
surfaces of this colon, decomposing and
causing an acute form of inflammation.
The vermiform appendix, being attached
to this inflamed colon, becomes inflamed
also. In other words, this inoffensive and
useful little organ suffers the penalty of
being in bad company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Old diagnosis
correct</div>

<p>Thus it is seen that appendicitis, so-called,
is merely a form of fevered or
irritated colon; hence the old-fashioned
diagnosis&mdash;"bowel
inflammation"&mdash;before appendicitis
became popular, and profitable,
was in reality correct. Knowing the
cause&mdash;the physiology of appendicitis&mdash;the
remedy becomes a simple one.</p>


<h4>APPENDICITIS&mdash;THE SYMPTOMS</h4>

<p>The symptoms of appendicitis (bowel
inflammation) are usually pain, at times
sharp, but generally dull, in the lower
abdomen on the right side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>


<h4>APPENDICITIS&mdash;THE TREATMENT
(IN MILD CASES)</h4>

<p>If the pain is dull and intermittent,
the patient should cease work, especially
that vocation which necessitates being
on foot, and spend at least twenty-four
hours, most of the time in a sitting or
reclining position. All such substances
as meat, cereal and cereal products,
sweets, milk, tea, coffee, cocoa, and all
stimulating beverages should be omitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A natural remedy</div>

<p>The patient should take high enemas
(knee or chest position) of lukewarm
water, thus removing as
much of the congested fecal
matter as possible. Take
from two to three tablespoonfuls of olive-oil,
and two or three cups of hot water
several times a day. The application of
an ice-bag will sometimes afford much
relief, and has a tendency to reduce the
inflammatory process. Too much emphasis
cannot be laid upon the fact that
in any inflammatory condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
stomach or intestines, rest for these organs
is imperatively demanded.</p>


<h4>APPENDICITIS&mdash;THE DIET</h4>

<p>After the first day or two, the following
diet should be adopted and continued
for a few days until the pain has ceased
and the bowels are restored to normal
action:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">BREAKFAST</p>

<p>A cup of hot water</p>

<p>One or two exceedingly ripe bananas peeled
and baked in a hot oven</p>

<p>One egg, whipped five minutes; sugar to
taste; flavor with lemon or fruit-juice</p>

<p>A glass of water</p>


<p class="center">LUNCHEON</p>

<p>A salad of anything green</p>

<p>Liberal portion of boiled onions</p>


<p class="center">DINNER></p>

<p>Spinach, or a green salad, same as at luncheon</p>

<p>Green beans, or peas, if in season, rejecting
all the fiber; or, carrots or parsnips</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>

<p>Two whipped eggs</p>

<p>Baked banana, with butter or oil</p>

<p>These menus are intended as a
general guide. They may be
modified by selecting such articles,
in the same general class, as are
in season.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following list of foods may be
drawn upon to compose the menus, at
the various seasons of the year:</p>

<h5>CHRONIC OR SEVERE CASES OF APPENDICITIS</h5>

<p>The errors in diet that cause fermentation
and superacidity in the stomach will
also cause fermentation and inflammation
in the intestines.</p>

<p>A constipated condition in the intestines
so hinders the natural flow of food-matter
that in extreme cases of inflammation
and suppuration the congested
matter might be forced into the vermiform
appendix, thus causing what is termed
"appendicitis," and under these conditions
the removal of the appendix might
be advisable, but in the opinion of the
writer more lives have been sacrificed on
the operating table than the old-fashioned
doctors ever lost from "bowel
inflammation" before this dis-ease was
named "appendicitis," and before the
knife was applied as a remedy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment in severe cases</div>

<p>There should be injected into the
rectum a tablespoonful of olive-oil, followed
immediately by an enema of hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
water at a temperature of about 115
degrees. This should be retained as long
as possible. In order to aid
in this process, the head
might be lowered, and the
feet slightly elevated so as to relieve the
strain upon the rectal muscles. In very
severe cases an ice pack may be placed
over the lower abdomen for five minutes.
The ice pack should be kept in place
until the temperature is lowered and the
pain relieved.</p>


<h5>THE DIET IN SEVERE CASES
OF APPENDICITIS</h5>

<p>From three to four quarts of cool water
should be taken the first day and all food
omitted. The second day fruit-juices
and olive-oil should be administered.
This treatment should be continued for
several days, or until the pain is relieved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
when the diet for milder cases may be
adopted in a reduced or limited form.</p>


<h5>DANGERS OF INTESTINAL
CONGESTION</h5>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of
appendicitis</div>

<p>All conditions of bowel inflammation
are caused primarily by congestion of
fecal matter in the intestinal
tract. That which will relieve
congestion, therefore,
will, by removing the causes, relieve inflammation.
Intestinal congestion has
become one of the most common disorders
among civilized people, because
of the fact that a large percentage of
the coarse material known as cellulose
fiber has been removed from their food
by super-civilized methods of preparation.
For instance, in modern milling
methods, every trace of cellulose is removed
from the grain, leaving nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
but a white mass of unbalanced food
material, largely carbohydrates, and the
peelings are removed from all kinds of
fruits and vegetables. Thus the diet of
civilized man has become woefully impoverished
in cellulose and mineral salts,
with the result that there is nothing left
in the diet to stimulate the liver and the
peristaltic activity of the intestinal tract.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils of the
civilized diet</div>

<p>This condition is largely augmented
by flesh food, all
sedative drugs, and intoxicating
drinks which have become so conspicuous
in the diet of modern civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why coarse
food is necessary</div>

<p>The intestinal (digestive and eliminative)
organs of man, through the millions
of years of his development,
have been built up on the
primitive plan. They have
been shaped by the process of ages to
accommodate coarse food, therefore a
generous amount of non-nutritive cellulose
is absolutely necessary to both the
digestion of food and the elimination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
waste. The liberal use of cereal bran
puts back into the diet that which modern
milling methods have taken out of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedial
value of coarse food</div>

<p>The use of wheat bran and the seeds of
grapes in the treatment of appendicitis
has both a scientific and a
common-sense basis. The
bran and the seeds pass into
the various folds, wrinkles and turns of
the intestines, and sweep out the congested
fecal matter which is undergoing
decomposition and causing inflammation.
After the bowels have been thoroughly
cleansed, the patient should adopt a fresh
vegetable diet selected from the list heretofore
given, drinking an abundance of
water both at meals and between meals.</p>

<p>Under these conditions most symptoms
of appendicitis will disappear, and if the
diet is made to consist of a sufficient
quantity of coarse food, all causes of
bowel inflammation will be removed.</p>
